Everyone my age has social media and is unhappy with their usage 
of it. Nobody wants to delete instagram or TikTok due to FOMO, making 
social media a Lose-Lose.
My understanding is that people seem to be like "this is so good, take it away from me".
Weather or not it's an easy thing to do, I think it is a harmful medium for entertainment, and I believe there should besomerestrictions put in place. The US is built on freedom of the people, which kinda conflates the issue into another lose-lose.
For me at least, I think Instagram should allow users the ability 
to FULLY disable reels from their feeds, YouTube (which is rotting gen 
alpha even harder) needs to be legally required to allow users a toggle 
as well, and essentially all linear doom scrolling apps like TikTok need
 to be regulated in terms of how hard they can suck you in.
It's like advertising cigarettes at an AA meeting anytime I try to
 get off the short form stuff and YouTube blinds me with the exact same 
garbage, and many people waste hours of their lives because these 
corporations have managed to hold you in as long as possible.
Another solution I think could work is regulating the algorithms 
for these apps to prevent them from being too good and damaging 
attention spans and work ethics. I think it'spossiblesomething like this could be implemented if the masses see it as similar to a drug, which we regulate all the time.
TL;DR: All apps need a functional off-button to short form, and maybe algorithm regulation.
Thoughts?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[GreatGameMate]: Shouldn’t be regulated, but encourage, I like the  the ideas you 
stated “ability to disable reels”. . people should be able to decide for
 themselves, and have the ability to customize. otherwise if they are 
underage the parents should be responsible for their child.
[Netblock]: Social media needs to be (heh) socialised, communistically owned 
in some way. It being owned by capitalists, if there's a for-profit 
nature to it, then there exists a financial incentive to make it as 
addictive as possible.
It needs to exist at all cause it's the town's square of the internet.
[alphafox823]: for minors, absolutely
I think there's a good question as to whether anyone who's under 16 or 18 should even be on social media at all.
[RubberChicken-2]: There’s no such thing as a “little censorship.” It is pervasive and evil.
a "little censorship" will inevitably turn into 1984, it's only a matter of when.
[PermissionSoggy891]: a "little censorship" will inevitably turn into 1984, it's only a matter of when.
[erkose]: Young minds, navigating their developing belief system, should be protected from the zealots.
[RubberChicken-2]: There’s already a control for that. It’s the POWER button on your 
computer or phone. If you want peace and civility, turn off all of the 
attention-grabbing devices, and TALK TO EACH OTHER!
[PermissionSoggy891]: Depends. I don't think kids should be allowed on these platforms 
without restrictions on their account, but that responsibility falls to 
the parents.
I like the idea of being able to disable certain parts of the app,
 I kinda hate how insta's time limit stuff will just shut down the whole
 app including the DM function.
But the second you let the government start calling the shots, you open the door to a whole lotta censorship bullshit.
[illdecidelater22]: People need to learn how to control their own behaviors. People 
shouldn’t need to be babysat. Everyone needs to be responsible for their
 own habits and addictions.
[WildlyAwesome]: Just don’t be a loser who gets stuck scrolling through reels and 
shorts for hours then complains about it. Instagram for me is just a way
 to connect with buddies online and send memes. I’ll watch reels 
sometimes if I’m on the toilet. “Oh nooooo I can’t stop scrolling!!!” 
Just fking turn off the phone and go do something.
This isn’t an individual issue. That’s like saying “just never smoke meth, problem solved.” to a degree.
The point would be to allow people to better able to avoid it.
For most people just “never smoke meth” works.  If you literally 
can’t turn off your phone as an adult because of short form content then
 natural selection is probably doing humanity a favor.
You can just not get on social media. I use Reddit almost 
exclusively for entertainment at work and then when I go home I barely 
look at my phone.
It’s called:self control

AI is not a monolith that causes all harm to the world and is pure
 evil, its a tool that can and has helped many people with so many 
things (like detecting skin cancer) but that doesn't matter to them 
because AI is their "villain" and "pure evil" that will "steal" their 
jobs
I feel like they hate AI (GenAI) because of their insecurities and
 fears that something artificial is better than them, they are so scared
 of losing their jobs even thomost of them would hate those said jobs at massive studios that use AI, they say buzzword like "AI is about experience" or smth even tho its clear its aboutmoney
Another thing is "AI sentience"... its not real, AI (ChatGPT, 
Gemini, Grok, Etc) arw a algorithms based on research/training, its not 
sentient and never will be, it will not be Skynet or Hal or any sci-fi 
AI because it can't think, it can only replicate and emulate human 
interactions like cleverbot which came out in2008
So in short AI is not a monolith, Antis Hate AI because of insecurities and fear, AI will never become sentient, etc...
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Jared187]: AI has the potential to be a very useful tool, the problem is that
 it's currently owned in mass by hyper-greedy corporations that would 
rather destroy the world for a buck than try to work towards anything.  
On the subject of AI sentience, I would certainly agree we're nowhere 
near it right now but it's not a mathematical impossibility. Give 
quantum science and neural networks about another 100 years of research 
and we might have a different answer. It's really too nebulous to say 
anything concrete.
[Character-Day-8999]: That why AI bubble needs to pop, when trash will be gone people 
will finally recognize the usefulness of AI tools that could and most 
likely will help us
[iBolitN]: Ahhh, the insecurities card being played even here. Over-hyped, 
90% useless even at most suitable tasks and forcefully applied 
everywhere tool surely needs even more promotion by shaming skeptical 
people.
[[deleted]]: I’m a GenAI hater. I’m also a Masters student whose future job 
will not be impacted by AI at all. I do not fear that AI is better than 
me at my job, nor am I insecure about it.
I hate GenAI because I feel as if using it has made myself, and 
others, dumber. As soon as I stopped using GenAI (which I did for like a
 few months to help with school and daily life with severe ADHD), I felt
 myself getting my intelligence back. Critical thinking was easier, 
school became easier, my brain fog started to lift, and I became more 
patient with getting answers to things. I believe there are studies 
seeking to learn about how GenAI use impacts grey matter, but last I 
checked all we currently have isthis study from MIT.
I also think anti-intellectualism is a rising global phenomenon 
that I abhor. This is a huge component as to why I’m anti GenAI. I do 
not believe any good comes from a populace becoming dumber, which I 
suspect GenAI contributes to. So it’s less about my own insecurities 
(which in my case don’t exist, because I know I’m better in my field 
than any LLM), and more about how I see GenAI use as a net negative on 
society. This isn’t even considered the resources used to maintain data 
centres or any other environmental impacts of GenAI.
[Character-Day-8999]: Your comment just screams "miserable rant/vent ahh"
Also why bg removers shouldn't exist, its like saying everything 
automated should exist since "its taking away skill", so we should all 
work in factories again since some people lost their "skilled job" then
What I'm saying is... Money isn't flowing like it did in the old 
days! Don't you feel it? Making money in general has become a lot 
harder, because everything is automated, free, cheaply outsourced, or 
nobody has the money to spend on freelance services anymore, because 
they themselves are struggling financially. So no, my comment isn't 
screaming "miserable rant/vent ahh". It's straight facts. The good old

I don’t know if it’s just me, but lately every app feels like it’s
 stuck on max volume. Every take is extreme, every comment turns into a 
fight, and it feels like you’re supposed to pick a side on literally 
everything.
Meanwhile offline life is just… normal. People are way nicer, 
conversations aren’t constant debates, and no one is screaming opinions 
24/7.
I’m Gen Z but sometimes it feels like the internet version of us 
is way more intense than who we actually are day to day. Curious if 
other people feel this too, or if I’m just burned out from scrolling too
 much.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[__Kazuko__]: Welcome to the age of algorithms. The things that get to us the 
most, emotionally, also tend to get more engagement from us. So what do 
the algorithms do? They push the more extreme things to grab our 
attention.
And what happens then? We end up training our brains to think of the most extreme examples and not about nuance.
They are unfortunately why it feels like extreme views are more 
common nowadays. And (again, unfortunately) the algorithms also 
inadvertently brainwash some folks because they’re having the same weird
 stuff that generates engagement pushed out to them all the time with no
 reality check.
I think other commenters and yourself have already covered the 
whole ‘polished opinions’ thing so I won’t go over that too much, but 
maybe also think ‘polished extreme opinions’ where things will sound a 
lot more convincing when it’s spoon fed to us in a constant barrage.
I feel like I’m seeing some instances where OTT reactions are 
spilling over into real life as well where people seem to be quick to 
fly off the handle over something small. But maybe I’m just overthinking
 it, not sure.
The internet is a blessing and a curse. So are algorithms and AI. Interesting times we live in.
Yeah, this really nails how it feels. It’s like the internet 
constantly trains us to think in extremes because that’s what gets 
rewarded with attention. Nuance doesn’t travel well online, but outrage 
does.
What messes with me the most is how normal things feel offline in 
comparison. Most people IRL aren’t nearly as intense as their online 
takes, but when you’re scrolling all day it starts to feel like that’s 
the default reality.
I don’t think you’re overthinking it. If anything, noticing it 
probably means you’re a bit more aware of how much this stuff shapes our
 reactions.

[GoodResident2000]: People are more respectful when they can’t just talk shit and log off
Yeah, exactly. There’s way more accountability IRL.
Online it’s just too easy to say something extreme and disappear, so everything escalates faster.
I would say Reddit is particularly bad for this, as our little avatars give us anonymity

[zanamyte]: They're just competing for your attention.
But if you feel like you're scrolling to much, it's because you are. Perhaps find a hobby outside social media?
I get what you’re saying, and you’re probably not wrong. I think 
the part that messes with me is that even when I’m not scrolling that 
much, the tone online still feels… dialed way up. I do have offline 
hobbies, but coming back online always feels like stepping into a louder
 room than I left. Maybe it’s less about time spent and more about how 
platforms reward extreme takes.
Sorry if I came off as critical, it's good you have things to do offline.
The way I see it is, the internet has always been like that, and 
it will get worse. We have to be aware to not let its negativity affect 
us.

[PhD_in_Ark]: The number of people I see online who are the most pathetic losers
 possible is absurd. It is not at all proportional to the outside world.
If you live your life completely offline, you are usually part of 
some friend group or community that is in similar circumstances and 
thinks mostly the same way about life. If you ever encounter someone who
 has weird values, theres usually a conflict between them and your 
group, after which everyone forgets about it and moves on living 
normally and interacting with people who share their interests.
Social media gives EVERYONE IN THE WORLD, the opportunity to spit 
out their poison and be a weird freak without suffering any direct 
consequences.
[[deleted]]: Comment deleted by user
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Online gives people time to 
curate their thoughts instead of reacting in real time, so everything 
sounds more confident and extreme than it would IRL. I think that gap is
 what makes it feel exhausting sometimes. You’re not just talking to 
people, you’re talking to their most polished opinions.

[Teanison]: Yeah, not to say it's 100% not as loud IRL (some people really are
 loud and show it to a degree,) but for the most part, IRL is much 
quieter.
[Ok_Storm_282]: Well not so much anymore because cancel culture has swapped sides 
so conservatives dont really care and leftists now are scared of getting
 cancelled.
I get what you’re saying, but I don’t know if it’s really about 
sides swapping as much as everything just being amplified online. Feels 
like the internet rewards the loudest, most extreme takes no matter 
who’s saying them, while most people IRL are way more chill and nuanced.
 That disconnect is kind of what’s been throwing me off lately. Offline 
conversations feel human, online ones feel like they’re built to 
escalate.

I know tailored algorithms have been a thing for a long time so 
it’s not just that, but I remember a time when we actually had slow news
 days and everyone had room in their feeds for the news to pop up. 
People who didn’t use social media or anything obviously weren’t tapped 
in and aren’t tapped in now, but I remember a time when a President 
would do something mainstream headline news worthy every once in a while
 and everyone would hear about it no matter what your algorithm looked 
like really.
Whether its the “flood the zone” 24/7 news cycle exhaustion 
strategy, dead internet theory (propaganda campaign bots) taking over 
Meta with fascist political content therefore pushing people off the 
platform, or the algorithm bubbles getting smaller and smaller… it’s 
seriously like everyone has their own little reality with its own 
headlines.
Someone’s headline might say “Trump administration violated the 
Constitution again” someone else’s headline says “Trump upholds the 
Constitution again”. And then someone else’s says “5 new tips to 
increase metabolism rates” and someone else’s says “RFK Jr swims in shit
 swamp” and someone else’s says “Scandal at the Biden residence: Are 
They Performing Gender Reassignment Surgery on Trans Illegal Immigrants 
with YOUR Tax Dollars?” or “Taylor Swift ‘upset’ and ‘shocked’ over 
being ‘dragged into’ Blake Lively’s Defamation Lawsuit”.
Like I have seriously never met so many people who don’t know 
what’s happening. I don’t know that I even blame them fully for it, I 
mean yes people are ignorant but the news cycle will actually shut 
people out if they aren’t actively seeking it out. It’s become so taboo 
to talk about too because it’s an instant fucking vibe killer so news 
doesn’t even spread by word of mouth anymore like it used to.
I don’t know. It’s very frustrating because I feel like I’m 
watching a bomb go off every day but the bomb was made in a certain way 
that i’m the only one who can see the bomb , like a sick new 
psychological torture method.

So basically for a long time honestly ever since like middle 
school I spent lots of time online. Obviously i still use the Internet 
like everyone but I just find myself doing it, less now.
I think one of the main reasons at least for me personally is the 
decline of youtube, that used to be where I spent most of my time online
 but less so now. The youtube algorithm is terrible now, And I think a 
lot of youtbers just got worse. It's not like I even make the conscious 
effort to spend less time online, It's more like im trying to find 
something interesting on youtube,  realise there's nothing then stop. 
Obviously there's still some good creators but it's hard to find them 
now cuz of the shitty algorithm.
Other websites like social media that I use are slightly better, 
but due to toxicity I often find myself getting mad or sad so I don't 
wanna use them too much. Honestly reddit is arguably the worst offender 
here, it's algorithm and search is actually decent compared to other 
websites but the amount of toxicity, hate and malicous bullying on here 
is more than I expected, it's Similar to twitter. Instagram I mostly use
 for memes, cool photos/vids and people I know irl, but due to not 
having a proper search it's not really that nice to use.
I also used to spend a lot of time playing video games on discord 
with my friends, even once i got to college at first we still did it a 
lot as I had no one in college. But now they all play stuff that I don't
 like so I don't really engage with it anymore much. And I know other 
people now so I don't need to rely on them as much.
Also im trying to get a gf now and I REFUSE to use a dating app. 
Everyone who uses them seem to be incredibly miserable for some reason.
So yeah obviously I still use the Internet and stuff, but I do it 
much less than before simply because I don't want to. Also nowadays 
since I'm in college I can go outside or do activities whenever I want, 
which makes it easier.
Tldr: Internet is a lot more boring nowadays and seems to always make me mad due to toxicity.

I work with computers, so I'm online at least 8.5h a day. There is
 enough you can do online. For example: A new southpark episode aired. I
 have to watch it, didn't do it yet. So I have to go on a ship and sail a
 little bit like a good pirate does.

Most of their online PR campaign is the same age old tropes , this
 guy is fascist, muh fascism bad. Like ok ?  Five star and Italian left 
tried that in 2022 and it led to nothing tangible , Meloni today is 
actually fairly popular and on track to get reelected , few average 
italians whose votes are up of grabs thing of her as a fascist ( even 
though her party has like mussolini's grandson as a important member 
lol)
Even in US , they scream everyday Trump this , Trump that, they 
still win jackshit and hardly see their margins go up.  you know you can
 win if you run a campaign like my boy Mamdani ? he is a socialist and 
still doing so well (omar and Talib can only dream of something like 
that lol) ppl arent really stupid to just keep voting for status quo if 
your election strategy is just "how are you gonna vote if not us ? Trump
 ,that fascist "

[SundaeThis7858]: Hey guy? A senator was drug out of a government building for 
asking a question, and new government employees have to write an essay 
about how they would advance trumps personal policies, and he’s having a
 military parade on his birthday, I don’t think you know what fascism is
He was politely escorted out and immediately released. I saw 
exactly what you did. Stop exaggerating. It gets you a point, you know?
No, being politely escorted out is being politely escorted out. 
Being forcibly removed from the room, pushed to the ground, and 
handcuffed (all of which was done on video) is objectively not being 
“politely escorted out.”
TIL they started screaming muh dictator , just yestarday , on a 
contrary you dont how to read or what fascism is .  you can hear all 
this because media is independant , if he was fascist you know cnn would
 be forced to praise him . Plus guess which party has a trifecta in DC ?
 the point of the post was not if he is or is not , its that ppl whose 
votes dems want to court dont give a shit
Was hitler only a fascist when he began overtaking the government?
 Or would it have been fair to call him a fascist when he was speaking 
with fascistic messaging during the 1920s?
If you go through the signs and symptoms, you'll probably find that the Republican party is actually a fascist party.

[javierphoenix]: I mean. You are not denying most of these points, you are just justifying on his behalf.
In logic, we use evidence to support arguments, and a collection 
of arguments support a claim. The claim here is that Trump is a fascist.
The arguments are based on the definition of fascism. You are not 
disagreeing with the definition, so we have common ground.
The evidence builds up to support each of the arguments 
separately. For instance, point C: suppress dissent. What I have stated 
by itself, doesn’t suggest that Trump is a dictator. But it does suggest
 that he uses power to suppress dissent. Using power to suppress dissent
 is one of the characteristics of a dictator (or wanna be dictator).
Wanting to be a dictator, or exercising the power thereof, is a 
characteristic of a fascist. That’s essentially how I have treated this 
conversation. If you go point by point, and agree that the point is 
valid, and you build it up, little by little you will begin realizing 
that Trump fits the definition of a fascist.

It's also a characteristic of anyone who gets a little power 
hungry. That's why I push back on it not meaning fascism. Just 
authoritative.
No, no. Let’s go back to the original definition:
Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian ultranationalist political 
ideology and movement characterized by dictatorial power, forcible 
suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the 
economy. It typically involves a single-party state, a strong sense of 
national identity, and often, militarism.
You agree with far right, you agree with authoritarian, you agree 
with nationalist, you disagree with dictatorial (but agree with 
authoritarian), you agree with intend to suppress opposition (but not 
enough has been done to suggest full suppression), you don’t really 
agree with regimenting society or the economy (but honestly, the 
evidence would suggest intent in many ways), you agree with wanting a 
single party state (although admit it is highly unlikely), and I am not 
sure if you have an opinion about militarism.
Isn’t that at little bit fascist, by definition?
Did you miss when I said I think you're cherry picking things he 
does and making it fit fascism? Because that's exactly what you're 
doubling down on here. You're even blatantly dismissing the nuance I 
introduced by glossing over them in paraphrased parentheses.
So I think we have to agree to disagree. I don't think Trump's 
fascist. You think he is. I don't think we are changing each other's 
mind here. Good back and fourth though, I appreciate it.
Should we wait until he goes full fascist?
You'd certainly have a better argument.

[The_Grizzly-]: It’s similar to how the right calls everyone else who isn’t them a communist.
They’ve been proudly calling THEMSELVES communists for over a decade now, what do you mean 😭
Wrong, Democrats have always clarified that they are capitalists 
since the very beginning. So are most centrists and independents. I 
never said only left wingers or actual communists, I talk about everyone
 who isn’t a Republican which includes many centrists and independents.
With all due respect, I went to school with the types of people 
I’m talking about. I didn’t have Zoom university to narrow my 
perspective on who my peers were. How could you say that no one voting 
Democrat is also self-styling themselves as a Communist? You just reject
 that idea 100%?
centrists today ARE Republican voters…
Communists who vote Democrat doesn’t mean that everyone who votes 
Democrats are Communists, and that doesn’t mean that Democrats in power 
are Communists.
You are saying anyone who isn’t a Republican calls themselves Communists which is wrong at best and disingenuous at worst.
I did NOT say anything of the sort 😭🤣 dude dont do that lmaooo. 
I’ve never seen such an egregious attempt at a straw man argument
Not a strawman, it’s solely based on you and I said, “everyone 
else who isn’t them”, and you said “they’ve” which encompasses everyone 
who isn’t a Republican. That’s on you for not being specific enough.
how do two wrongs make a right ?
It’s just having them taste their own medicine. If they get to 
call us communists, we get to call them what we want, otherwise it’s a 
double standard.

It feels like everything online is about becoming the “better 
version” of yourself, new routines, morning habits, constant “how to 
stop being lazy” advice. It’s like peace turned into a full-time job.
Most of us aren’t even broken; we’re just drained from pretending 
we need to upgrade constantly. Half the stuff that’s actually ruining 
people isn’t loud, it’s quiet. Fake comfort, constant comparison, saying
 yes when you don’t mean it.
Theis is a shortvideothat
 breaks it down really well, not motivation, just honesty about how we 
keep trading peace for noise without noticing for whoever’s been feeling
 that same burnout.
Do you think this whole “self-improvement” culture is actually helping people, or just making everyone feel behind 24/7?

making money. The only people in your life who actually have a vested 
interest in helping you succeed are your parents, biologically speaking.
In all honesty I have pretty much given up the economy is 
terrible, no one gives a shit I have a degree but my college still keeps
 asking for donations.
people selling you courses on "how to make money", that's how they

I see those posts offending Gen alpha and pointing out with jenzy did when we were younger and all that.
News, flash, it's not the same
They say that we were exposed to a very cringe content Back then, 
but At least we like 8-12 Years old when we stumbled upon Content like 
With Limited internet access that Meanwhile Gen Alpha with unlimited 
internet Access and no parental controls Most of the time And are given 
ipad At the age Literally 6 months Are exposed to rain rock cringey 
content add As young as 3 Years With unlimited unfiltered internet 
access and can go on social media at any time I I know our generation 
has that problem as well but Gen alpha Has That even worse being Exposed
 to the unfiltered Content of the Internet at very young ages And 
rotting their brain And having psychological effects on them at much 
younger ages
At least our cringe content had passion and heart port into it. With genuinely talented creators and other stuff
While genalpha has brain rock content Mass produced by content 
farms aka Elsa gate And skibidi toilet Being nothing more than cash 
grabs To profit off of young children And you know for a fact And you 
know for a fact that Coppa Does not work at all because kids can lie 
about their age On the internet all the time
It's a fact
They are being exposed to brain rot Content with No passion Only 
being cash grabs And exploiting Them With brain rott content farm 
content And Elsa gate being exposed to at such a young age And the 
algorithm Keeps recommending this brain rock content to them And they 
fall into a loophole Watching it over and over Again and it cannot be 
compared to tv It's not as addictive and it doesn't have an algorithm To
 what you like
At least when we discovered upon those cringe may Brain rock 
videos on accident or when we were just browsing and see what's just 
interesting
I know our generation has a lot of those same problems, but Gen 
Alpha is worse because they're being exposed to that exact same thing, 
if not, worse at much younger ages.
That's the only difference. It's being exposed to that kind of stuff at a younger age and a lot more often
So please stop trying to defend That Gen Alpha
The internet bullies kids all the time. It's useless. We've been through that before
Edit: How Gen Alpha got into this mess blame their parents for 
their awful parenting and being the worst generation of parents

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
The reaction I’m seeing to the ban of TikTok, an app controlled by
 the Chinese Communist Party, has once again made me aware of how out of
 touch Gen Z is with the world. The truth is most Americans can’t 
stomach what goes on behind closed doors at home, and in the shadows 
overseas to make this country what it is. Gen Z certainly cannot stomach
 it. Gen Z may be the most aware alongside millennials of all the dark 
shit our country does to remain on top, but Gen Z is the most intolerant
 of it, while being the most oblivious to the necessity of it. It’s 
nothing new - young people want to tear shit down - they’d rather throw 
the baby out with the bath water than tolerate a system which they find 
repulsive. But guess what? The world needs America. If all of the young 
people got their way and tore America down to its roots, the world would
 get much much darker. Gen Z seems completely naive to just how dark 
China and Russia are, along with their allies - and just how badly they 
want to be in our throne. There is this bullshit sentiment amongst young
 people that because America has skeletons in its closet, that somehow 
Chinese and Russian narratives are to be trusted.
Yes your precious app got deleted because it was controlled by a 
foreign government which attacks and undermines our country at every 
turn. A foreign nation that is well on its way to displacing us because 
of its ability to rapidly transform and develop with the aid of its 
totalitarian control of its people. China has been ripping off our 
intellectual property at the highest levels - they’ve infiltrated our 
universities and corporations and stolen knowledge and research that 
took decades. They execute cyber attacks on our systems, and run 
currency manipulation schemes. Their military trains daily to 
specifically combat us. Make no mistake: they are our enemy.
Show some fucking patriotism, and if that’s too hard for you, at 
least take a step back and look around at how good we’ve got it compared
 to so many other places. It sounds cliche but god dammit are you guys 
privileged to be born in the USA. This toxic doomer mentality needs to 
stop, because the alternative is your quality of life getting way worse 
with China at the head of the world. There’s a nation of over a billion 
people, with a growing middle class that now outnumbers our entire 
nation. What gives us any sort of fighting chance of maintaining our 
grip on the world and providing it with some semblance of freedom, if 
our own youth is siding with China. And don’t give me some bullshit 
about how “America doesn’t provide freedom to the world”. Look at North 
vs South Korea, and read the Wikipedia about that war. America and its 
dealings are so far from perfect and clean, but god dammit the 
alternative is DARK. The combination of TikTok brainrot propaganda and a
 failure of the American education system + “COVID kids”seems to have 
created major gaps in history knowledge amongst younger people. I urge 
you to read up about life in China during the cultural revolution, life 
under communism in Eastern Europe, and the very real consequences of 
communism extant today in places like North Korea, China, and Russia.
Go use Instagram reels if you can’t handle your crippling dopamine
 withdrawals. What the fuck is the big deal. I don’t give a damn about 
the “businesses” on TikTok, booms and busts happen all the time. It’s 
not just about data, which I hear over and over again - TikTok is 
literally manipulating public opinion in the USA. We have a foreign 
adversary dictating an algorithm and moderating censorship on an app 
with a direct line to millions of Americans.
Additional thought: Lots of comments about “tech oligarchs”. Guess
 what? China has their own. Your choice is if you want billionaire tech 
oligarchs controlling the narrative, or Chinese communist tech oligarchs
 under supervision of the Chinese communist party controlling the 
narrative. The fact that you guys are presenting the narrative that our 
real and only enemy is our own billionaire class just shows that the 
TikTok propaganda has really gotten to you. People in the comments 
saying “fuck America” are a prime example of the infection within Gen Z 
caused in a large part by TikTok brain rot propaganda. Again: America is
 far from perfect, but I assure you that China is far far worse.

[HatefulPostsExposed]: “Why are politicians banning social media apps and not doing something about healthcare, housing, or the environment???”
You (collectively) rejected a politician with plans to handle all 
of these things for a con man who knew the secret to lowering egg 
prices.  Vote differently next time.
I’m not going to deny that Americans are some of the dumbest 
motherfuckers ever to walk the face of the earth, but dems made it hard 
for people to vote for them. Dems didn’t jingle the keys.
Imagine being the 2nd most powerful person in the country, not 
doing anything, then claiming "if you elect me to 1st most powerful, 
then I'll do something."
Biden passed the most legislation since the 60s during the two 
years he controlled the house and senate including drug prices, 
infrastructure, and green energy.  Then republicans won back control 
during the midterms.  So no, Harris could not pass anything.  Stop

[[deleted]]: Real fucking patriotism is understanding that America isn't China.
 It shouldn't have to be stated that banning an app for our tech 
oligarchs to take over is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.
Who says that the “tech oligarchs” will have full control of 
social media? We can have an alternative app that isn’t run by a foreign
 adversary.
When who is musk if not a foreign investor? He’s a tech oligarch 
here and will apparently have the incoming Cheetos ear. Sounds like 
foreign interference to me.

[Reminaloban]: There can be two "bad guys" here. The US being a corrupt, 
dictatorial oligarchy that is stripping away the rights of its citizens 
does not at all invalidate or disprove the corrupt and dictatorial 
things China's government has done to its own citizens (i.e. Tiananmen 
Square, suppression of the 2019 Hong Kong protests, ongoing cultural 
genocides in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, etc).
[Virtual_Piece]: You know that you can have multiple enemies right?
[Dont_Ask_Me_Again_]: That is an enemy within no doubt, but don’t forget those forces 
exist within China as well. Gen Z has no concept of picking the lesser 
of evils and is delusional to think they’re going to change the entire 
system without destroying America and allowing the world to fall into 
the hands of China.

[Reminaloban]: I'm sorry, what do North Korea and East Germany have to do with 
this? Germany has been reunified under the BDR (Federal Republic of 
Germany, formerly West Germany) for nearly 40 years, so what relevance 
does a country that hasn't existed in over a quarter of a century hold 
here? Nobody here said or implied anything about North Korea, either. 
Any sane person would agree that, given the thousands of documents and 
other sources on North Korea's human rights abuses and hereditary 
dictatorship, North Korea is one of, if not the most hellish and 
oppressive countries on earth and that North Koreans are experiencing a 
special, torturous kind of hell that nobody deserves.
Allu/Yodamortpointed out was your double standard on who has the right to enforce global hegemony.
Because those are examples of a clear distinction between a country propped up by America vs. China/Russia.
The United States has propped up many dictatorships. For example, 
the United States propped up Syngman Rhee in South Korea, and turned a 
blind eye to South Korea's numerous dictators (Rhee, Park Chung-hee, 
Chun Doo-hwan, etc). It was the people of South Korea that made the 
country what it is today, not the US. The US also propped up 
dictatorships, and toppled democratic governments in Latin American 
countries, simply because the US sought to impose its will and exploit 
those countries and their people. Everything that China and Russia can, 
and should be criticized for, the US can equally be critized for.
Now compare it to Russian and China and you’ll understand my point
You’re still failing to understand my point. You’re just chanting “China/Russia XYZ, so American imperialism is fine”.
Yes, because those are literally our options. That’s the whole 
fucking point of this post: Gen z live in a delusional reality where we

loosens its grip on the world, the power vacuum will result in China, 
Russia, Iran, North Korea, etc. gaining strength and imposing their 
objectively worse conditions on areas formerly under American influence.
You’re remaining willfully ignorant to the fact that American 
imperialism is just as harmful and destructive as Chinese and Russian

close, as far as manipulating public opinion that is happening on every

manipulation, that is not unique to China either, your stooge Musk 
pulled it and so did Trump with their bitcoin shit. And why should we 
have a grip on the world to begin with? We are not the arbiters of right
 and wrong, everyone has a right to live as they see fit without the Us 
telling them otherwise, The issue is not with Tik Tok being taken down 
it is with the government trying to censor social media that they do not
 control. We have seen Leon and Zuck the Cuck bend knee and get away 
from fact checking to allow false information and religious zealots 
control of their platforms, and that is why the exoduses occured. this 
generation is no where near stupid enough to not think for themselves

[anomalou5]: To sum it up: many Americans are unable to accept the concept of 
the imperfection of humans and their institutions for the whole of 
history, and unable to see it’s all just a scale.
Some cultures and countries fall closer to “better for stability and good in the world” and some fall farther.
In either case, unethical and immoral actions take place regardless of where one falls on the scale.
But because Americans are fed a line of bullshit about the 
“perfect” behavior someone should exhibit while in power, they think in 
pure extreme binaries.
And thus they believe America to be worse across the board than 
many other countries in a variety of traits. Because they don’t care 
about their privilege, because they still have it.
Someday they won’t have it, and then they’ll perhaps understand. 
Until then, America = not good enough (or just outright the most evil)
[Careless_Lunch_7293]: Yes this post is definitely going to fix things. Way to generalize an entire generation.
[Apprehensive-Ice9809]: "how out of touch Gen Z is with the world" -- I want you to watch 
the congressional hearing involving Tiktok's CEO. The senators were 
literally asking if you turn airplane mode on that grants Tiktok the 
ability to control the plane. They also asked if they watch for your 
pupil to dilate to promote that content. They also kept asking if the 
CEO is apart of the CCP when he continuously said he was Singaporean. I 
could go on. These "leaders" are all old and out of touch with the 
world, and especially tech, which they should not be making decisions 
about. It is genuinely embarassing.
False dichotomy
[Dont_Ask_Me_Again_]: False dichotomy
[SirCadogen7]: God, you idiots are almost as bad as the tankies.
America's grip on the world should be completely released. No one 
country should ever have a "grip" on the entire fucking planet. Not 
until we're all part of 1 country.
And I've read the reports on North and South Korea. No crimes 
committed by the other side will ever justify ushering a bunch of 
civilians in a cave and then throwing grenades in until the screaming 
stops. No actions taken by the Vietcong justify whatAmericansdid totheir own allies.One side can be objectively worse without excusing the actions of the objectively better one.
Being a "patriot" is loving your country enough to want it to 
constantly improve. That includes gutting a corrupt system over time and
 replacing it with a better one. Our government as it stands is somewhat
 fucked, and it needs to change. Denyingthatis unpatriotic you imperialist fuck.
I'm an American and watching a felon insurrectionist get elected isfucking embarrassing and enraging beyond belief.I don't want to be embarrassed of my own country. I want to be proud to
 say I'm American. But I'm not. Because we are showing the world that at
 the end of the day we're nothing more than people like you: idiots. 
Useful idiots.
Fuck the CCP and fuck Trump and his oligarchs.
America releases its grip on the world, and China and Russia take 
its place. That is the entire fucking point of this post. Your mentality

That is simply not how this works. No one has to have a grip on

having that grip without having it ourselves.
Additionally, wanting toimprovethe US doesn't release its grip anyway, though it should.

I feel like I'm stuck. I look at my feed and it's the same things.
 Even when I search for different things the content doesn't change. Do 
you feel the same? What does your content algorithm looks like? I'm 
curious.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Anonymous_Coder_1234]: I use the Reddit mobile app on Android. In Reddit you can make 
"Custom Feeds". For example, I have one Custom Feed that is just 
computer programming question and answers related stuff. I use that 
Custom Feed when I want to answer computer programming related questions
 on Reddit (I sort that feed by "Latest" to see the newest programming 
questions). I have another Custom Feed that is more news and 
statistics/data liker/DataIsBeautiful. I have another Custom Feed that is just subreddits about my local city/county/state.
The nice thing about Custom Feeds is that they only show content 
from the subreddits that you add to the Custom Feed. Like my computer 
coding question and answers Custom Feed never includes news from my 
local area and my local area Custom Feed never includes computer 
programming stuff. After I create a Custom Feed, I can create a shortcut
 to it and put that shortcut icon on my phone's home screen.
But yeah, if I want to avoid what the algorithm wants to suggest to me I use a Custom Feed.
Oh, and have a NSFW [Not Safe For Work] Reddit account that is 
totally separate from your main, safe for work Reddit account. I don't 
like having random porn suggested to me when I'm trying to answer 
programming questions and I don't want to see programming questions when
 I'm looking for porn.

Lately I’ve been feeling a weird kind of burnout with mainstream 
social media. I’ve been online since around 2010 , making friends, 
sharing life updates, exchanging gifts  and I used to love the 
interactive atmosphere.
But over the last few years, something’s changed. Everything 
feels… performative. Every app seems to push the same trends, the same 
recycled content, and the same pressure to post something “interesting” 
or perfectly curated. And the moment I put up a photo, I catch myself 
worrying about likes, follows, or whether I’m being judged ,even when I 
tell myself I shouldn’t care.
I still use Instagram mainly to keep up with real-life friends, 
but if it weren’t for them, I think I would’ve left already. I miss the 
feeling of posting just to express something, not to perform for an 
invisible audience or an algorithm.
Is anyone else feeling this?
Are there any niche or smaller social platforms where you can just
 exist without the pressure to impress or something that feels more like
 hanging out than competing?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[alyakimmikayla]: Totally feel like this too, I feel like the platform has been this
 way always, but it’s definitely been worse post Covid. I delete and 
redownload Instagram quite a bit. Yeah, I’ll likely redownload, but the 
spurts of delete time are a nice little break for my brain.
[kristen-outof-ten]: totally agree. I used to have SO much fun on social media. 
especially since Trump was elected for the second time it took a 
dramatic change. imo it's because the algorithm has gotten so good most 
of it only shows you what you like the most or whatever feeds your 
anger, so you never see new things anymore. I mostly only use YouTube 
now and even trying to pick a video on YouTube feels like it's all the 
same shit. and if you go on insta or tiktok it tries to show you stuff 
that'll piss you off because that's how most people keep engaging. like 
how "top comments" aren't the most enjoyed but the most controversial 
comment that literally nobody agrees with. I seriously miss the internet
 I grew up with in like a weird way. it made me feel less alone and it 
made me understand people better as a teenager. now all it makes you do 
is feel more alone. and it's only going to continue to feel more lonely 
with the rise in AI. I dont even have social media downloaded anymore.
[BrooklynNotNY]: Yeah, somewhere around 2014 people seemed to start wanting 
perfectly curated profiles on IG. Instead of having 10+ pictures on 
their profile they’d only have like 1 picture posted at a time. Or 
people would go in and unfollow a bunch of people to make it seem like 
they had “fans”. It stopped being a place to post fun and funny pictures
 with friends. Now everything close to fun is cringe and corny.
I think it all started with snapchat and their filters + 
kardashians influence, making everyone want to post perfect pics instead
 of fun, in-the-moment ones
[Wellbeinghunter69]: I think it all started with snapchat and their filters +

[untrustedlife2]: Tumblr and Mastadon. Bluesky is okay too. I deleted my instagram, 
Twitter, threads, and I don’t go on Snapchat. And moved to tumblr and 
bluesky (I already had mastadon) and haven’t really looked back also 
feel way less addicted.
[poptimist185]: I was around when Facebook started and can’t remember it not being
 performative. “Look how exciting my life is! All these parties and 
travelling”
[betteroffw]: I went from performing in 2015-2023 to nothing at all. Don't have 
insta, twitter and don't post myself anymore. I've chosen the anonymous 
life of just scrolling reddit and tiktok and it has taken away the fear 
of being perceived.
[Old_Question7185]: Pinterest, Bondee . Compared to main social media,they are more peaceful.
[JoeMamma559]: Yea. It’s getting worse and worse. I only have Snapchat for my 
friends and Facebook for my family. I wish there were a new type of 
platform younger generations like us could communicate on. Without ads 
and scrolling. A new way to communicate and share things. Maybe one day.

I watch a few political youtubers like Sam Sedar and Hasan but 
mostly watch gaming and nerd related content. I've noticed a ton of ads 
for things like Tim Pool, PragerU, and Turningpoint USA, along with 
their videos popping up in my suggested feed. Has anyone else noticed

Yeah, and I actually don’t see that because I just block people and down that stuff and the algorithm is adjusted for me.
I also dropped most of the default subreddits, and have alts sorted by mood and area of hobbies, work etc.
You’re just holding Reddit wrong
Lol you cannot block Hegetsus spam. You cannot adjust a right-wing

[Blitzking11]: I have literally never clicked (and stayed on) a right-wing video 
for any longer than it took to find the blatant bias (which is usually 
on the nose, as the commentators will say something derogatory about a 
minority quickly), yet it continuously pops back into my feed.
Right wing content is absolutely boosted, because if you get 
sucked into it, it will be very difficult to escape, as you are 
constantly told everything bad is not your fault.
Similar to the Church or other "culty" groups that isolate you and preach that the problem is "others" and not yourself.
Do you click off, or do you block the channel? I mostly get nerdy tech stuff and cute animals.
At the very least down arrow stuff, but you use these options a few times the algo takes a fucking hint.

 audience actually was...but he really is one of the biggest pieces of

some of his chatter and they sound like some actually violent and

I dont know why people keep up with these ... arbitrarys 
statements about how oh thing i hate is actually doing bad and thing i 
like isnt. It doesnt mean anything. And all this political stuff doesnt 
mean anything anyway because non one knows what is objectively true.
See, I actually like some of the Daily Wire and I legitimately 
doubt your statements and even if is true, its probably out of context, 
and with more data I'd almost assure you that it's NOT going to shut 
down because you say these things out loud.
An interesting thing I noticed after the election though was the 
bread tube or whateveer you call it had HUGE viewer drops . and Im 
ppretty damn sure that all the conservative youtubers are doing pretty 
well, in fact i think the left is  far in denial they just need to 
convince themselves these things are true so they can sleep at night.  
Because I know i sleep REALLL nice watching Ben Shapiro an Jordan 
Peterson and Mattt WAltz and you know, all the boys ...........
ALso, the left STILL cannot MEME
"It's not real and if it is it's out of context because I said so"
Holy shit the right is actually delusional. This is an entertaining read, thanks
Also: No, i actually don't watch Hassan! I am merely stating a fact. And no i'm not a fucking liberal lmao
Well you provided NO sources for any information so naturally, if 
you, the liberal want to make a point , you needd sources. But you 
believe what you read and I dont. So maybe try to think that I CAN say 
its out of context, IF YOUR SHOW ME NO CONTEXT
Im not gonna look it up, i dont care, so you need to PROVE to me 
not act like a bitch and think you're right when you cant even source 
what you say
You're the one whining in a reddit reply section about how you're 
too lazy to google something. You cannot say something is out of context
 at all if you don't even fucking try. That's the thing about right 
wingers, they simply will not try so they can believe whatever reality 
they want
but here. I had to pull this from "evangelicaldarkweb.org", so now
 that kind of website being in my search history is probably gonna fuck 
with my algorithms for months
But back to the point: Right wingers are provably notorious for 
spreading misinformation and the current admin has done nothing but fuck
 over the country, the people, the relations with literally every 
country on earth, and the economy by appealing to right wing desires. 
Cry about it
Right like im spreading misinformation about being a right-winger 
so you thnk that i spread misinformation and its a mindfuck
How do you even know im right wing, I consider my self an 
anarchist who voted for trump, so reconcile that. I dont need to care 
about politics THAT much like the left where you need anti-depressants 
and valium. But actually avoiding politics IS good for your mental 
health and I know that personally.

See, I actually like some of the Daily Wire and I legitimately 
doubt your statements and even if is true, its probably out of context, 
and with more data I'd almost assure you that it's NOT going to shut 
down because you say these things out loud.
An interesting thing I noticed after the election though was the 
bread tube or whateveer you call it had HUGE viewer drops . and Im 
ppretty damn sure that all the conservative youtubers are doing pretty 
well, in fact i think the left is  far in denial they just need to 
convince themselves these things are true so they can sleep at night.  
Because I know i sleep REALLL nice watching Ben Shapiro an Jordan 
Peterson and Mattt WAltz and you know, all the boys ...........
ALso, the left STILL cannot MEME
"It's not real and if it is it's out of context because I said so"
Holy shit the right is actually delusional. This is an entertaining read, thanks
Also: No, i actually don't watch Hassan! I am merely stating a fact. And no i'm not a fucking liberal lmao
Well you provided NO sources for any information so naturally, if 
you, the liberal want to make a point , you needd sources. But you 
believe what you read and I dont. So maybe try to think that I CAN say 
its out of context, IF YOUR SHOW ME NO CONTEXT
Im not gonna look it up, i dont care, so you need to PROVE to me 
not act like a bitch and think you're right when you cant even source 
what you say
You're the one whining in a reddit reply section about how you're 
too lazy to google something. You cannot say something is out of context
 at all if you don't even fucking try. That's the thing about right 
wingers, they simply will not try so they can believe whatever reality 
they want
but here. I had to pull this from "evangelicaldarkweb.org", so now
 that kind of website being in my search history is probably gonna fuck 
with my algorithms for months
But back to the point: Right wingers are provably notorious for 
spreading misinformation and the current admin has done nothing but fuck
 over the country, the people, the relations with literally every 
country on earth, and the economy by appealing to right wing desires. 
Cry about it
Right like im spreading misinformation about being a right-winger 
so you thnk that i spread misinformation and its a mindfuck
How do you even know im right wing, I consider my self an 
anarchist who voted for trump, so reconcile that. I dont need to care 
about politics THAT much like the left where you need anti-depressants 
and valium. But actually avoiding politics IS good for your mental 
health and I know that personally.
[[deleted]]: Hasan literally makes thousands every stream, phillip defranco on 
YT has been going strong as a business, and Last Week Tonight is one of 
the most popular shows on HBO even after so many years. Meanwhile, the 
Daily Wire, a pinnacle of far right garbage vomiting, just laid off 25% 
of its staff, is on the verge of bankruptcy, and shut down key parts of 
its business operations lmao
Hasan Piker? Really? You watch that?  I always wondered who Hasans
 audience actually was...but he really is one of the biggest pieces of 
shit ever to stream. He breaks TOS pretty much anytime he wants with no 
consequences and its really not chill. Like ya know Promoting a 
terrorist org on stream. Or saying American deserved 9/11 .... Ive seen 
some of his chatter and they sound like some actually violent and 
unhinged .....liberals.
I dont know why people keep up with these ... arbitrarys 
statements about how oh thing i hate is actually doing bad and thing i 
like isnt. It doesnt mean anything. And all this political stuff doesnt 
mean anything anyway because non one knows what is objectively true.

[notdexterslab]: A few things I recommend you look up:
Filter bubble effect
The alt-right pipeline, especially seen on YouTube (Source 1,Source 2)
Furthermore, the above channels you listed often utilize clickbait
 and attention-grabbing topics/thumbnails to generate clicks. Clicks = 
views = ad $$$, so from a business standpoint it makes sense for YouTube
 to recommend videos it thinks you're going to click on, regardless of 
whether you align with the views represented in them.
Useful info! Def gonna read through that whole article later today!
[Affectionate_Show867]: Useful info! Def gonna read through that whole article later today!
[Strong-Handle-3026]: Yes. Cambridge Analytica etc, we've been over this. There's nothing neutral about the algo
[devil652_]: Sure
[Several-Chemistry-34]: twitter youtube reddit facebook insta twitch have/had left wing bias and suppressed or censored rw stuff
“They suppressed conservative views” means “they banned me for calling someone the n word”
[fourenclosedwalls]: “They suppressed conservative views” means “they banned me for calling someone the n word”
[11SomeGuy17]: Yes. The right wing is better funded (for obvious reasons). The 
left wing is dead on the wider political stage, and the center, though 
decently funded, cannot by definition take particularly strong stances 
against the right which means they largely are saying "We wantright wing talking pointtoo but like this because its nicer." Which isn't particularly 
appealing to the algorithm as watered down right wing talking points 
aren't controversial nor does it create particularly interesting 
discussion. This means in terms of mass media in the modern age the 
right has a massive advantage over all other political positions. 
Especially in the modern era where information is super easily accessed 
in spread, money matters a lot, algorithms then amplify this because 
controversy creates engagement. Engagement drives up ad revenue and meta
 data to sell which is highly profitable. This means the content 
algorithms spew will always be far enough right to cause outrage, but 
when all discussion and voices being amplified are right wing, their 
ideas go mainstream so algorithms pull further right people as they are 
the most engaging now, this creates a feedback loop that helps drives 
the general populace further right.
The algorithm looked at you, saw you engaged with political 
content, and decided to send you political content that gets the most 
engagement to try and milk more money out of you.
[[deleted]]: It’s complicated. The mainstream media itself is overwhelmingly 
left wing. Like CNN, BBC, MSNBC, etc all together basically only with 
FOX as the only right wing source.
As for social media though, I mean if there is a right wing bias 
it’s pretty new. I mean how fast people forget the history that before 
Elon Musk owned twitter, the previous owners literally banned Donald 
Trump and others from the platform. Are you saying that’s not left wing 
social media bias?
Mainstream media is generally centrist, not left-wing. But the 
right is so extremist now that the center might as well be communist.
Bro the media hasn’t been centrist since Vietnam. You can 
objectively look at media bias charts in terms of reporting and 
reporting style. I’m not even right wing, but saying “the right is so 
extremist it drags everyone” is a very convenient excuse to not concede 
that the media is mostly left. The same way FOX does full coverage of 
the RNC, companies like CNN and MSNBC do full coverage of the DNC.
There hasn’t been a real left wing in America since the McCarthy era.
Why do you equate left wing bias with the most extreme form of socialism?
I don’t, Trump voters do.
You’re the one that brought up the McCarthy era. So you’re saying 
that nothing can just be generally left wing? That the only way a piece 
of media could be considered left wing is if it’s purporting ideals that
 are the most extreme form of socialism or communism? That media could 
not be left wing biased unless it was these things?
Those people weren’t extreme. They got us all our worker’s rights.
We’re talking McCarthyism itself, not its practical application or
 who was involved. You’re wasting my time becusse you don’t know what 
you’re talking about.
What exactly are you asking? McCarthy was a right-wing extremist 
who considered anything left to be commie and dangerous even when it 
wasn’t.

[slothbuddy]: If you make a new account on any social media platform you will be
 shown some right wing content and no left wing content.  It's a real 
problem
Why do you think that is?
Right wing content is driving views which generates revenue.  
There's also the fact that left wing views aren't supportive of the 
capitalism these companies thrive on, so ideologically they not at all 
incentivized to intervene

[Fun-River-3521]: Tbf i get recommended left wing content too that i don’t 💯 wanna 
watch it’s not completely one sided at least i think so but it is 
alarming that i see right wing content is more popular.
[Vic_Vega_MrB]: Ha... Right wing bias? Are you kidding? Say something pro-trump here and see how many times you're downloaded...
[[deleted]]: Depends
[Personal-Reality9045]: The right wing ultra wealthy billionaires pay to get that shit on 
your feed so they can continue to grift you and keep you broke.
Best tool of oppression money can buy.
this was like a poem......but im not gonna tell ya it was a great 
one but it feels so....absolutely telegraphed from somewhere else
How have you been oppressed today by that way?
[[deleted]]: this was like a poem......but im not gonna tell ya it was a great

[[deleted]]: How have you been oppressed today by that way?
[emteedub]: yes. The right wing pumps tons and tons of money into those right 
wing content creators, where the left types of content creators (at 
least the legit ones) are not taking money from the likes of democrat 
funds or any interest-conflicting sources - majority report only has 
sponsors that are vetted with scrutiny so that they're not 
endorsing/perpetuating any form of corruption. tim pool will take money 
and then skew messaging to their will.  turningpoint and pragerU are a 
plague, even worse imo, since they target children with severe right 
wing ideology nearly exclusively - there is no debate about that. they 
are a disease, untruthful yet masquerade as the truth, and receive 
boatloads of money by right-wing elites and special interests to do so 
(while giving the image that they're self-sustaining... even having 
demand... when THAT is even fabricated)
Be diligent.  It's real vs. fraud.
[fleabeak]: It probably depends on the political party of the app's owner/creator tbh.
[ThegreenMoray]: 100%. It’s not even close
[[deleted]]: depends on the website
[DimMak1]: Yes there is a massive right wing bias according to the vast 
majority of independent media analysts who study media and run the 
metrics.  The algorithms also push right wing propaganda to the top of 
the trending categories and individuals feeds while suppressing 
progressive topics.
[Sisyphus704]: Online censorship goes down, people opinions stop being self 
filtered, and so everyone has a wider spectrum of opinions being 
presented to them. That’s not remotely “oh NOW social media has a right 
wing bias”
[JohnnyRC_007]: My guy... Do you watch Hasan Pyker and think there aren't enough 
left-leaning sources on the internet? Buddy...  the internet has plenty 
of left-wing thinkers. You can find what ever you want if you look.
[Angrybirdsdid911]: Actually, YouTube is notorious for algo banning right-wing stuff, 
like when they permanently demonetized Crowder's channel. Must be the 
algo thinks you are interested or will be soon
That's the thing though, I've never shown any interest in that 
side of things. Maybe it's because Sam and Hasan mention Tim and Charlie
 Kirk a lot so they think they're adjacent?
Yes, there’s way more to it than your individual choices. It’s 
titles of the videos you watch. It’s the amount of times someone says a 
key word or name. If Hassan says Charlie’s name 50 times in a video, 
you’ll probably be suggested a Charlie video.
It's probably the gaming that'll do it. Tim Pool occasionally 
talks about gaming and if you're in college and looking at 
college-adjacent subjects Charlie will probably pop up for you because 
he goes to a lot of colleges.
But overall I don't think for the most part social media has a 
right-wing tilt more like the opposite. But if you're looking at typical
 male-related content like video games they might try seeing if you like
 moistcriticle or Joe Rogan.
Keep in mind YouTube has millions of engagement data to go off of 
to make a pretty good educated guess as to what content you might jive 
with even if you don't know it.
Maybe they recommended to you so you could hate watch?
[Affectionate_Show867]: That's the thing though, I've never shown any interest in that 
side of things. Maybe it's because Sam and Hasan mention Tim and Charlie
 Kirk a lot so they think they're adjacent?
Yes, there’s way more to it than your individual choices. It’s 
titles of the videos you watch. It’s the amount of times someone says a 
key word or name. If Hassan says Charlie’s name 50 times in a video, 
you’ll probably be suggested a Charlie video.
It's probably the gaming that'll do it. Tim Pool occasionally 
talks about gaming and if you're in college and looking at 
college-adjacent subjects Charlie will probably pop up for you because 
he goes to a lot of colleges.
But overall I don't think for the most part social media has a 
right-wing tilt more like the opposite. But if you're looking at typical
 male-related content like video games they might try seeing if you like
 moistcriticle or Joe Rogan.

wanna see those ads? Its content specific. Young men are going red,  and
 they like video games. and nerdy shit they need to gatekeep from the 
crazies
Youtube also tries to give you adds based on your "taste" . so 
yeah young men watch those things and its not really a SLANT but the 
liberal side has NO GOOD CONTENT and thats been true for over 10 years

TÍTULO: Don’t glamorize prior generations’ lives : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Because I’m GenX, Reddit’s algorithm thinks that’s the same as 
GenZ, so I see y’all’s endless fretting over how you can’t afford the 
same lifestyles of prior generations. What you don’t understand is stuff
 was just shittier back then. My dad drove a truck like this when I was 
little in the early 1980s. My brother and I would ride in the back, 
behind the front seats. If you’re wondering how a seat could fit in that
 spot: Imagine the crappiest kid’s booster seat you’ve ever seen. Now 
make it much worse and set it on the floor of the truck, not bolted 
down, with its back to that little side window, kids facing each other. 
Add a lap-only seatbelt and call it a day. For reference, Datsun 720 
“king cab”.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[PatientEconomics8540]: This truck goes hard wtf. Whats the point of there being an 
abundance of $80,000 trucks if no one can afford them? Also, the before 
times were better. People could live off one income, even without a 
degree. Shit is rough now.
Finances were just about the only thing better about the 50s-90s
but that one thing effects the accessability of everything else that has gotten better.
medicine is better now but good luck affording it if you aint squared away with a good white collar job
Medicare and Medicaid recipients get the same healthcare as any 
white collar job.  Look up the stats on how many people are on those 
programs
single motherhood was a lot less common, especially among black kids. (20% vs 70% today)
Gee i wonder why? It’s not like the military was busted shipping 
drugs into black neighborhoods in the 70s/80s and contributing to the 
rise of the street gangs? It’s not like a war on drugs was then declared
 so they could arrest those people and disrupt their communities.
Oh wait all of thatdid happen
In a capitalist world, finances are EVERYTHING
The before times were better for certain people, but not the 
majority at all. Things were better for the white middle class in the US
 and Western Europe. The rest of the world has rapidly improved their 
living conditions since then and are objectively better than they used 
to be. Global poverty and hunger even when I was kid were way worse than
 they are now. This site is mostly Americans, so I get it, but that is a
 distinction I think should be made if we’re talking about all of GenZ. 
Even in America, shit is almost certainly better now if you are a 
minority or a woman.
I’m speaking from an American perspective. With that things have 
gone downhill for labor rights, minority rights, and women’s rights. 
Cant speak for the rest of the world though, I’m sure things have 
improved in other places.
That’s fair, that’s why I added the caveat. Shit is definitely 
backsliding in the US, though I still think the average person is doing 
better now than most of the people in the past. We’re headed in the 
wrong direction though, so who knows how long that’ll be true
If you live like someone’s the 50s you can live off one income too.
Every meal at home with half the portions we eat today.  No out of season foods unless you are rich.
One driving vacation to family members house per year -No internet
 -No cable -No electronics -One car for an entire family that you repair
 yourself — go buy the shittiesr smallest car on the market without 
power steering.
people’s houses were in places with shitty weather because you never went far from were you were born.
healthcare was so rudimentary that they basically had one 
antibiotic (penicillin).  If you got sick, healthcare was you sitting in
 a bed in a hospital dieing because they didn’t have modern equipment.  
For example, you couldn’t get a heart bypass in the 60s unless you were 
rich because it was only invented in 1960 and took time to spread across
 the country!  So basically, even the worst healthcare today is better 
than 1950s healthcare
If you want this life it is obtainable today.  Don’t confuse the 
middle class looking life that the richest people in America lived in 
the 1950s with what you would have lived then.
This is an excellent YouTube video idea.
The financial crashes in the 90s were horrific.  So many people 
lost their homes.  Interest rates were doolally.  In the UK unemployment
 rates were much higher in the 90s.  The economy was still transitioning
 from manufacturing to services and many people simply weren't 
employable any more without significant retraining.
Many things did feel better, but financial security, in my experience, wasn't one of them.
Spot on. Adjusted for the inflation this 4x4 Datsun 720 with crew 
cab brand new was something like $28,000 in today's dollars, that's a 
fucking steal, take my money. The shittiest new F150 these days is 
$40,000 and it's a lame 2WD trim so it's useless off-road.
Yup. Though cars have improved (for the most part) their costs 
have far outpaced inflation and wages. US truck manufacturers are 
setting themselves up for another bailout.

[CryptographerNo29]: Literally people now can't afford to ever own a home. But do not 
glamorize previous generations because I had to sit on a crappy seat in 
my dad's truck. Sit tf down. 😒
It depends on what you can find in the boonies that’s where to look
I live in the boonies. Houses that used to go for 120k are 400k now.
Not good at all I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you can find 
maybe something to do a remodel fha loan if you look but you will have 
to save up for it.

even have that as an option.
millennial here but they made movies about how stable office jobs 
where literally hell lol like Office Space and Fight Club.
Don’t give them ideas. Like we need more boutique soap companies.
Millennial here - yes I remember my dad saying his sister worked 
full time at McDonald's to pay her way through college. Shit ain't

[ctbowden]: While the backseat of this truck is a shitty place to sit, these 
Datsun trucks were tanks.  My dad and brother rolled one like 7 times.  
My uncle and I drove that truck home the next day, no windshield but 
still mobile.
I had a relative drive one of these until the floorboard rusted out, literally.

[Prudent_Permission10]: Not true, things were objectively made better for the most part. You can’t tell me nothin.
The filthy corporations hadn't figured out planned obsolescence yet
I've met plenty of people in their 50s who've explicitly told me to never listen to people like OP.
Cars weren't. Minimal safety features, all of them would rust 
away, carbs are a pain to keep running, motors usually wouldn't even 
make it to 60k miles because real motor oil caused them to die really 
quickly. What we got now is so much better, even going out and buying 
whatever $3000 clunker from the early 00s you can get on FBMP would be 
better than anything from back then

[grifxdonut]: If riding in the back of trucks is the best you can come up with 
for overly glamorizing your generation, you had it much better.
Bro, Domino's wasn't open 24/7 back then and white people didn't know about avocados. It was really rough.
[SlavaAmericana]: Bro, Domino's wasn't open 24/7 back then and white people didn't know about avocados. It was really rough.
[Akipac1028]: Dunno dude. I wish I could get a 1970 Oldsmobile442Cutlass for a first car as a deli-worker or a Iroc Camaro for a handshake and a case of beer like my dad did.
[BrilliantThought1728]: Wow you gen x’ers really dont get it do you?
[[deleted]]: And you could buy this for three nickels and a walnut. That’s what
 we’re glamorizing. Home ownership is a lofty ideal for much of Gen Z. 
Objectively, the average cost of everything has risen disproportionately
 to median income. This is a measurable truth. We have to work more 
hours to buy the same things than yall did at our age. Rent is a WAY 
higher proportion of our income.
I’d rather have a supposedly crappy truck than literally no truck.
This was 6250 then. So like 20k in todays money for a stick shift 
four banger with manual windows. A new maverick starts at like 28k. It’s
 much safer and a better value. And I love these trucks and all old 
vehicles. I’m just being real.
Edit: The downvotes are very funny. Some of you are so accustomed to playing victim you can’t even respond to logic.

[Illustrious-Fox4063]: At least the Chevy S-10 Extended Cab seats folded up into the 
sides below the windows but everything else applies.  Buddy when I was 
in high school had a Subaru Brat the seats in the bed didn't even have 
seat belts, just two OH JESUS! handlebars.
Yeah. However, those Subarus (pre-85) were absolute tanks. Edit: typo
Didn't really help when you were baja'ing over the red sand dunes 
and mesquite of west Texas at speeds that were dangerous on the open 
highway.
Goodmpoint, always wanted a Brat, but got a GL instead.

[Discussion-is-good]: Bro, this post missed hard because anyone paying attention can see
 stuff used to be made to last or be fixed. Now it's made to break and 
get a new one.
This can be applied generally without many exceptions that come to mind.
[ReginaldvonJurgenz]: Lmfao what kind of logic is this. Yeah things were just as bad, 
yeah homes and necessities were affordable relative to the typical wage,
 but we had to ride in the back of a sick pickup truck with no 
seatbelts. Get the fuck outta here unc
[Imaginary-Ganache-59]: My 93’ S10 Tahoe had the same rear seats, tbh I don’t really get 
what you’re getting after? Vehicles are safer and more reliable? Idk 
anyone who’d argue otherwise
[captainjohn_redbeard]: Good point, but terrible example. I bet that's a great truck if you don't need to seat more than 2.
[[deleted]]: Comment removed by moderator

Exactly this, he is completely forgotten that here in the 3rd

If you're still suffering trauma over your kiddie car seat as a 50 year old just do some therapy dude.
[FeedsPeanutsToCrows]: Uhh dude that truck is so fucking dope looking.
But it’s a death trap. Riding in the back of a pickup truck sounds
 cool and all until the truck rolls over. I went to high school with a 
girl who everyone knew as being a really fucking cool chick. She got 
launched out of a pickup truck bed, slammed her head into the pavement, 
and when she had “recovered” and came back to school, everyone just 
wondered why Mandy was such a surly bitch now. Fucking brain damage is 
no joke.
I remember riding in those tiny little fold-out seats where you 
faced the other passenger in the back as well. Not really comfortable 
and if, god forbid, you were on an accident, you’d get squished like a 
bug due to the practically nonexistent idea of the “crumple zone” in 
those older cars.
New cars are better in almost every measurable wayexceptfor looking less cool. Oh well. I’ll take my lame-looking-but-safe modern crossover.
[[deleted]]: Lol, I drive a 90s toyota truck. Cars back then are better than cars now.
[No-Consequence1726]: The constant fear of homelessness in a part of the world that's 
cold six months a year is worse than riding in the back of your dad's 
cool looking pickup
[gr4vediggr]: I once heard someone say the following:
"Back in the past, luxuries were expensive but needs were cheap."
A dryer used to cost the same as 1 or more months of mortgage, 
while now it's not even close to half the rent. Phones, televisions it's
 all relatively cheap compared to how they related to rent or mortgage 
in the past.
But with the pyramid of needs, basic life needs being difficult to
 obtain causes a lot more stress than luxuries can compensate for.
[densaifire]: My dad, who is GenX, is the first to tell me that he definitely 
had better opportunities as an adult despite having a harder childhood. 
He was kicked out at 17 but at 20 years old he managed to have a house 
payment, a car payment, and support a family of 3 and still be able to 
buy used cars for projects which were much cheaper then compared to 
today; all of this while making less than 10 bucks an hour. Me at 26 
years old making 20/hr, I can't even afford an apartment and a house is 
still well out of reach as starter homes that were worth maybe 60k years
 ago are worth almost half a million now. As for that Datsun, you can at
 least reliably work on it. Newer vehicles are designed with the 
intention of you bringing it to a dealership, which costs $, and 
overall, quality sucks worse nowadays, so you'll be repairing the pos 
quite a lot. Every time on my 2018 Impala, when I have to replace a 
light, I want to meet the person who thought it was a good idea to make 
it to where you have to spend 30 minutes removing the bumper just to 
replace a headlight and break their damn nose.
[camtec]: Ok great, but that Datsun 720 is $23k adjusting for inflation. A 
current base model Nissan Frontier is $32k starting. I get there is more
 bang for your buck with the new trucks, but a lot of them are so 
optioned up and marked up it doesn’t matter, you’re looking at around 
$40k.
The fact is, purchasing power in the US has fallen too. Gen Z is 
not saying “we were born into the wrong generation”, it’s more of the 
jealousy for the economic situation that older generations had.
[roadtrip1414]: alright alright alllriigghtt
[sassafrassaclassa]: Some of my best memories are from riding in the back of my aunts 
station wagon with my cousins looking through the hole in the car at the
 pavement underneath us.
This post is so out of touch with how people have completely different perspectives.
[BTTammer]: I learned to drive stick in one of those.
[OldUsernameIllegal]: Oh hey, my friend's mom drove us to the beach in one of those when
 I was a wee lad. I love those little fuckers. Great trucks. Pretty sure
 she still has it.
[CHRYNEXT]: I dont think you realize how these types of vehicles is what we 
need the most of nowadays. Cheap reliable stuff, not cushy expensive 
planned obsolescence items. I dont think you understand how bad shit is 
nowadays. I’m doing fine for myself now after a stroke of good luck, but
 shit man too many people i know take the bus because they cant afford 
piece of shit cars.
[Aggressive-Cookie815]: Tuh it was so fun in the 90s and I’m sure this truck lasted 25 years before it fell apart lol
[[deleted]]: I get the point you were trying to make and agree but the example you used sounds sick af actually
110hp.
Fuck yeah
[sluefootstu]: 110hp.
Fuck yeah

[Important_Lychee6925]: Tax wealth not work
[Agitated_Purchase451]: Brb, gonna pull up traffic fatalities over time, since all these people here think 80s cars are so great.

[Dear-Tank2728]: Ok but that trucks fucking sick tho.
[T_Rey1799]: Dude those jump seats were cool as hell
[FrostyChemical8697]: Am I tweaking this looks like a gta 5 screenshot
[TheoWHVB]: Bro showed us a sick car and hit us with the "you kids don't know how easy you've got it"
[acherlyte]: She’s a beaut
[S0uth_0f_N0where]: Dude, I want a car like this. Looks like it costs 30k brand new in
 today's market? I think I will glamorize the generation with affordable
 and slick looking vehicle's.
[Clean_More3508]: That truck looks sick
[RogueCoon]: Riding in the back of cramped trucks happened in our generation too. Home prices are way higher also though.
[NordKnight01]: That truck probably has a steel body. New ones are all fucking plastic.
Also, you didn't have to get addicted to the internet and gambling
 and porn while you were still underage because of social media. Sounds 
pretty tight to me.
[Capital-Ad-6349]: There's a lot I wouldn't have wanted to deal with back then. But 
the economy was much more livable, and when we're constantly compared to
 those before us being able to buy homes in their 20's, yeah it kinda 
blows.
[degradedchimp]: Your dad should've had you guys ride in the bed and kept the beer in the seats....
That's what my uncle did lmao

I’m with you there, except you would be hard pressed to find one

Arizona. Had to abandon it when he moved north.

[catboi-iobtac]: Instead of talking about actual social issues and economic issues 
to not glamorize the past, the biggest thing you come up with is not 
great seating in a truck as an example? There's so many other things to 
choose from that counteract the romantization of the past, and you chose
 this?
You chose the worst example for your point. The TLDR is literally 
"Car seats? Back in my day I was set on the floor of the truck. You 
think you have it hard?"
[Zeenyweebee]: LMAO we can’t even afford a shitty truck, should’ve saved and 
voted better. Don’t complain to kids about elderly decisions.
[[deleted]]: Millennial here. My mom had a nissan truck like this. I loved 
sitting in the back like that. It wasn't comfortable but it was fun and 
now we can talk about it. We can talk about how Mcdonalds looked or 
other experiences that have just been completely sanitized and no longer
 have any personality. I feel for GenZ for a lot of reasons and that is 
definitely one. Not to mention the housing thing. Fucking painful. I 
thought I was fucked when I bought a house in 2016 that was sold for 1/3
 in 2010ish, but now, if I tried to buy my own house in this market I 
don't know if I could afford it. Fucking sucks.
[Seaguard5]: Yes and no…
At least their mean salary could afford a mortgage…

[Interesting-Cow-1652]: You Gen Xers got to drive some gangsta looking vehicles. I'm a

 cars. I hate modern cars with their ugly ass curves.

I use Facebook just to keep up with family and what not. But it 
seems like my feed is just full of generative AI crap. I honestly feel 
like there should be some form of shadow banning added to the algorithm 
for these kinds of posts. The authors often exploit the algorithm itself
 by using stolen accounts to post the same soulless comments so it will 
be pushed to the front page. This isn’t even a Meta issue itself, I have
 found videos on YouTube that use ChatGPT prompts to write their 
scripts. Don’t even get me started on Twitter, ever since Elon’s 
takeover it’s insane how most of the comments are stuff not related to 
the content on the original post. Funny side note: some people found 
ways to trick the bots on 4/20 and it was pure chaos watching the bots 
expose themselves when posts about Hitler popped up. All in all the dead
 internet theory has aged like fine wine and I genuinely believe 
corporations need to do something about the generative AI posts. I’d 
even recommend removing monetization on such posts if it’s very clearly 
AI generated if they don’t wanna take the shadow banning route. Also to 
any bots reading this BAZINGA!

 was shocked that any of my friends would be doing something like that.

Opened youtube on my work computer and all the shorts were 
basically porn. My entire search history is about software I’m working 
with, why is this recommended? Because I’m a 23 y/o man?
My friend sent me a tiktok and I couldn’t open it unless I 
downloaded the app. I couldnt view it after downloading unless I created
 an account. Why do I need to verify my identity to view a godamn meme.
My TV plays ads if I turn it on and don’t immediately use it for something.
Twitter “X” is getting rid of their heuristic algorithm (which I 
thought sucked) and replacing it with an AI algorithm that doesn’t 
listen to what you’re searching for and just gives you what it thinks 
will grab your attention.
I looked up “woodworking tips” on google and got a fucking Hims ad
 as the #1 result, followed up by the location of all the Harbor 
freights in my area. Every search I make doesn’t try to show me what I 
want, it’s just attention algorithms fighting against advertisements.
It’s all shit. I hate the attention economy and miss when we could
 explore the internet without needing to have awareness on how not to 
get your attention and energy exploited because it was created by people
 with good will. I have notifications turned off on every app I have 
except for text because they all just bug you to open them up all day 
with their random notification like candy. It’s not as simple as “don’t 
have a phone” either, I literally can’t go a day without one in 2025 (my
 phone is the authenticator that I need to use over 15 times a day at 
work to log in to stuff.) Can’t wait for drones and billionaires to 
enslave us all.

The internet was once a place for creativity, expression, 
networking, and sharing. It's no longer meant for the people, the 
intentions are to hold attention and gain profits.
It turned from a cool thing into whatever this corporate garbage is now.
[foilhat44]: Well, I guess what I mean is that we must want to eat shit on some
 level because it's our money that's making them rich. At least in 
politics you can cheat if you're sophisticated and make it appear you're
 popular and have a mandate, the tech bros only get your money if you 
give it to them. No faking. I don't mean to rain on your rant because I 
agree with you.
Here’s an example of what I mean is.
I do: want to watch video on youtube
I do not: want 2, 30 second unskippable ads
I don’t want to eat shit, but I have to because youtube is the platform where the videos are.
If you define this as wanting to eat shit, then I guess you’re right in that regard, but I disagree
I mean that we ourselves are not to be trusted. Those ads earn 
more profit for the companies they promote than they cost to produce and
 air, and they earn more for Alphabet than the lost users cost them. If 
either of those statements weren't true you wouldn't see ads, but you 
wouldn't have YouTube either. It's a trap. Which is the bait for an even
 larger trap.

My thoughts exactly.
Not only to force you to interact with your phone, but also just 
to associate your account (on anything) with your phone number so your 
activity is easier to track across accounts. Wonder why using your 
Google account is the easiest option to make an account on anything? 
Gone are days of making a temp email, signing up through there, and 
forgetting about everything except a username and password.

In general the Internet is all about gaining as much of your

them.

[Haplophyrne_Mollis]: We monetized every platform are you shocked?
[JeanSlimmons]: Algorithms are all part of the enshittification process through 
this rediculous time. I used to love going on the internet and now it's 
plagued with ads, sponsored websites, and an AI that doesn't know what 
the hell it's talking about.
There are web browsers out there that don't do this as much.  
download duckduckgo on the Play store or just go to it on your web 
browser. There are other options out there for web browsing. It's 
refreshing to use honestly.

I’m not an important person, but the things I wrote were 
meaningful and from the heart. They are things that don’t come from my 
head alone but from a lineage of philosophy that could possible change 
the world. Someone mentioned the things I wrote usually are silenced by 
the algorithm but I didn’t know this applied to Reddit as well. Not even
 10 upvotes. It’s like we all want to loop again and again about the 
complicated issues. But they all stem out from the BIG issue which is 
our psychological nature. The fact that nobody is really talking about 
it proves my point that we have a disconnection to ourselves. What are 
we afraid of?

[Friedchicken2]: I read your post.
Honestly I think the reason it didn’t get traction is because 
we’re at a time right now where people don’t really care to hear about 
“being one with yourself”.
We’re growing up, having to figure life out, and having to figure 
out what we want our futures to be. A big election is coming up and 
taking up most of the space on Reddit. It’s just going to be how it is 
for the next few months.
I personally didn’t really resonate with your message, but that’s 
not because you had a poor message. I’m just not someone who thinks the 
way you do nor am I concerned with being “in tune” with myself. I have a
 lot of simple things I enjoy, but otherwise I gain satisfaction from 
doing the basic things life requires of me to do.
Others who are more inclined to think big will resonate more with your message, it’s just harder to find those people.
Edit:
I think you’re correct in your previous post that gluing ourselves
 to placating experiences like social media isn’t good, and we should 
try to experience more thoughtful things.
I just think right now the norm is social media and maybe in time it will drift away.
Talking about the “next MLK” is kind of what lost me because these
 types of individuals are a needle in a haystack for each generation and
 require a coordinated “need” that each generation requires. Maybe Gen Z
 will find their need eventually.
I hear you. When you mention that we’re not in the right time yet,
 it makes me think about that moment when the line blurs between “not 
ready” and “ready.” I believe it’s more of a gradient than a clear-cut 
moment. The ball starts rolling somewhere, and throughout history, 
there’s always been some energy or momentum behind these movements. For 
me personally, I felt something incredibly pure, something deeply human 
about those moments. After doing my own research and exploring life 
through this lens, I eventually discovered Eastern mysticism, 
non-dualism, and meditation. This led me to a practical study of 
psychology and how we build our identities around things that don’t 
really have inherent existence. This is just a nutshell. I’m really 
genuine about this shit.
I don’t blame anyone for not resonating with this message. 
Honestly, that’s not the point of sharing it. But I’d be lying if I said
 it wasn’t disheartening when I can’t connect more deeply with others on
 this. Of course, I’m not going to force anyone, but I think we’ve 
become so captivated by the motion of society—this dream we’ve 
constructed—that we’ve become attached to it. This attachment leads us 
to make decisions that aren’t truly peaceful or harmonious. Instead, we 
lose the ability to make decisions from a place of awareness and end up 
acting out of ego or our constructed identities.
In today’s world, everyone is talking about mental health and 
searching for solutions to the anger bubbling up within the youth. The 
issue is that we don’t know where to ground ourselves. If we identify 
with the things around us that are constantly changing, but never turn 
inward to discover who we really are, fear and anxiety arise when 
everything around us shifts. We start to feel like we’ll disappear along
 with those changes.
The art of being aware—of understanding how our thoughts and 
actions shape our reality—is incredibly difficult to master. We’re 
tested every single second of our lives. Maybe Gen Z needs that push to 
grab hold of whatever inner strength or power exists within them. And 
honestly, it doesn’t matter to me who leads this charge. I just love 
talking about it.
Using Martin Luther King Jr. as an example wasn’t the best choice 
because this goes beyond race and society; it’s about the frontier of 
our psychology.
Yeah that’s fair, wish you the best in finding those deeper connections with people around you!

[[deleted]]: The post was pretty vague and didn't really clearly identify a 
problem or give a call to action. Also I don't understand what it really
 had to do with Martin Luther King.
What I got from it was something about building a community and reaching out to people??
Someone brought up that MLK wasn’t the best example but I’m simple
 terms an actual thought leader that we can give a name and face to 
that’s leads social consciousness.
What I am specifically talking about is non dualism and how we can
 observe what creates identity in a world blurred by it. Allowing us to 
be more mindful of our thoughts which become actions that shape our 
community and country. History has shown us that this way of thinking 
was silenced. I wanted to know if there was anyone else that felt the 
same.
Non dualism? Are you referring to the religious concept or something else?
Yes . A religious concept which actually holds ground for profound
 psychological awareness. I can throw away all the religious stuff and 
still observe its motion.
Most religions aside from Zoroastrianism and maybe some adherents misinterpreting Christianity aren't dualist though?
That’s true but I have a strange opinion that you can’t escape the
 system of dualism because it’s a logic system at its core

TÍTULO: How to deal with the fact that with every job change you have to go through skills evaluation? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
In tech, every time you switch jobs you need to go through 
multiple stages of evaluation such as live coding, leetCode, etc.
I’m currently at the stage where I’m preparing for interviews. 
Honestly, software engineering work is completely different from what 
you have to show in those multiple rounds of interviews. It feels like a
 separate competition. Every time you get laid off or change jobs, you 
have to compete with dozens of other candidates to prove you’re the 
best.
The job market is so tedious when there are 200+ candidates for a single position.
Even though you graduated years ago, have solid experience, and 
can provide references, you still need to participate in this contest to
 get a job, grinding leetCode after hours.
How do you deal with that?
I already feel exhausted. It’s like preparing for an exam in 
college, except the scope of the requirements is completely unknown for 
each job application.
Sometimes I think maybe this year I’ll manage to pass the 
evaluation and land a job, but in 5 years they’ll probably raise the bar
 and invent even harder interviews because competition will only get 
stronger.
So how do you deal with the fact that becoming a software engineer
 almost doesn’t matter, that your previous experience often counts less 
than how you perform on their internal evaluation?
How do you take this job seriously knowing that in five years they
 could come up with even more ridiculous interview formats just to raise
 the bar higher? Even if you’ve already proven yourself and done 
excellent work before, the moment layoffs happen you have to go through 
this whole circus again, competing for weeks or months, passing stage 
after stage.
I’m totally burned out. I want an adult life and free time, but 
recently all of my free time has been eaten up by interview prep. One 
company tests you on algorithm problems like leetCode, another sends you
 a timed coding challenge.
I’m fed up. I wish there was some kind of license or 
certification, like in other professions, that would open doors to jobs 
without this endless evaluation. I already proved myself by graduating, 
earning a degree, and building real-world experience. I can provide 
references. I wish interviews could just be one stage instead of an exam
 that feels like school all over again.
I’m honestly considering leaving tech because of the lack of 
stability. Your previous experience often doesn’t matter, and when 
you’re 40, you’re still competing against people in their 20s who can 
solve coding puzzles faster. It feels dehumanizing.
I’d prefer a regulated job like nursing, where you just present 
your certifications and diplomas and don’t need to perform tasks to 
prove yourself again and again. The current system feels like a 
disrespect to people who have years of job experience.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[ghoztz]: Consider technical writing instead. It’s still a tech job and you 
can make like 80% the same pay but in most scenarios you aren’t given a 
leet code test. We’re more popular now that documents are a key input 
into AI. There’s also a range of technicality in the field. So you could
 lean towards documentation engineering. I make 180k base doing this 
plus RSUs. It’s a thankless and under valued position many forget even 
exist, but it pays the bills and I have more freedom than devs or PMs.
[OpeningJournal]: I'm a nurse, and I do training yearly, if not more. You just get 
used to it. I used to travel nurse and would have to repeat all the 
training every 3 months when I started a new contract. I used to joke 
that I could teach all the classes I sit through. Just part of life.
Yeah i have continuous training too. And lots of training. My 
first 18 months to 2 years on the job felt like an extension of school 
lol. Its a lot of training with multiple courses.
[Wxskater]: Yeah i have continuous training too. And lots of training. My 
first 18 months to 2 years on the job felt like an extension of school 
lol. Its a lot of training with multiple courses.
[Beyond-Salmon]: it’s the nature of the game for technical skills.
i’m a pilot and getting checked every 6 months -12 months is 
pretty normal. new airplane new checkrides. it’s also why more niche 
technical jobs get paid generally much much better than those jobs that 
don’t require that
[Wxskater]: Job applications for me were similar until i found my current 
office. It depends on the culture. My office fosters an opening door 
welcoming culture. And that shows in the interviews. But other offices i
 applied to absolutely were like that and as an entry level person at 
the time (my first job in the field outside college) i found it to be 
quite inappropriate to ask. Like you know my resume. You know im out of 
college. So i knew just by the interviews of what their culture was like
 and what they were looking for and it wasnt me. I kept that in mind 
when applying again bc i wouldnt apply to that office the next time 
around. So in my experience it does depend on the management, culture, 
and what they are looking for.

I see a lot of politics posting and just as often I see people 
commenting that they're sick of it. Usually IMO it's cause these posts 
have very grass is green takes like "republicans are bad because they 
support racist institutions and Donald Trump" or "Gun Violence is 
terrible." They're not untrue but there's no explanation of why. 
Standing by what you support means you should know why you support it, 
not just knowing that it's good or bad. People like explanation. If 
someone is ignorant, racist and wrong it's the easiest thing to call 
them stupid but explaining why what they believe is wrong is a much more
 productive conversation. People should go into the history and find the
 roots, not just see what's happening today. It all just comes off to me
 as algorithm formed. Not to mention people have a really bad habit in 
dividing things into left and right rather than realizing politics can 
have a range of perspectives that may be broadly right or left leaning 
but not totally, like certain religions or philosophies. I want to see 
more people care about what they say.

[Netblock]: Because they have theright to play; they haverhetoric on their side.
Arguably most people vote based on feelings, vibes, not facts. If you control the narrative, you control the people.
I think what most people don't understand is just hownewmost of these political systems are, historically speaking.
And culturally, we are just not up to the task of maintaining 
them, our social psychology is too diverse and too easily affected over 
long enough periods of time for there to not be massive breaks from 
political norms, institutional rot, corruption, and so many other 
things.
And that's because liberal democracy is not a form of government 
that makes intuitive sense to most people. A secular, bureaucratic, 
procedural state, that depends on the good will and ideological 
consistency among its constituents to survive is not a good fit for 
people who are flying off of instinct.
And that's what the right wing is, instinct politics.
It's the political manifestation of all the different ways people 
are not fit for a post-enlightenment society. They yearn for caste and a
 king and all the rigid ways that keep people in their place and allows 
for the abuse of power over others. That's why they give power to the 
churches, its why they want God in the schools, it's why they're wary of
 outsiders and want to go to war with anything they don't like. They 
celebrate ignorance and violence and they're always looking for an 
excuse to put someone in a grave or a cage and don't care much how they 
get there so long as they can finally let loose.
It's why they have no respect for empirical research, it's why they hate solutions to complex social problems.
It's beyond them. And as much as they may be forced to engage with
 institutions and problems that liberal democracy come with, if you give
 them the keys, they will destroy it.
And they'll think they're saving it while they do so because it 
genuinely doesn't reflect anything that they think and believe to 
organize society like that; with impartial rules that everyone is 
expected to follow, that you can't shoot and beat all the problems away.
These systems are doomed so long as these people are free to propagate and pass on their insanity.
Fucking poetry.
It's why I vote for the meteorite.

[MagicBulletin91]: It's why I vote for the meteorite.
[Adventurous_Ad7442]: Probably because people on the left actually have explanations for their opinions while MAGA just does not.
[AppointmentMedical50]: Different people might have different reasons. You should be able to explain the reasons why no matter what
[JamesHenry627]: Actually you do because even though on principle most people would
 be inclined to agree with them, people's tolerance goes up remarkably 
when those same people are powerful and make promises to make life for 
you better. You don't need to convince a supporter, you need to convince
 someone who is on the fence. Remember why that same orange guy made 
gains this election? Seriously ask yourself why? it's not like half the 
country genuinely supports a rapist pedo billionaire. If you don't know 
it's cause you don't know enough to explain it well. That's my point. 
you're the kind of person I'm talking about in my post. You're trying to
 argue rather than look into it and add in facts rather than scenarios.
Thing is I actually agree with your post. It is very well written 
and true. Where you lost me is saying people HAVE to engage with it. Not
 everyone has to have an opinion on everything. Let alone explain things
 to someone. If someone asks someone else to provide info on a subject 
they absolutely have no obligation to. Especially when there are usually
 better avenues and resources with the actual credentials to do so.
My point was that if you believe something you should have a good 
reason for it other than "I like it." You don't need to engage with 
everything but you're engaging now, and given the subject matter it's 
not unreasonable to assume that this what is the point at heart. If you 
agree like you say you do then this should be a no brainer.

[godfatherowl]: Why is it that Leftists think the arbitrary norms of their own 
social groups are universal and immutable truths, requiring no 
explanation?
I’ve never seen a right winger actually explain their opinion tbh
They fuck your feelings party sure have a lot of feelings with zero data and evidence to back up their claims lol
Yep! When they say “fuck your feelings” they specifically mean 
yours, not their own feelings. They are obsessed with their own feelings
Because a right wing opinion is fallacy.
Can you name one? Is it "The Trans"? Because biologists have that 
one settled. The science is done on that one, trans people exist and 
gender is a social construct built around sex which is very much not 
binary. This is not some radical ideology, this is science. The reason 
people hate having to explain that is because this is elementary school 
shit, you're an adult, and every time it gets explained, it gets refused
 as if it were an opinion piece.
Wouldn’t have been the issue I brought up, but you seem to be 
having so much fun talking to yourself, so I won’t get in your way. 🤣

[wetcornbread]: I’m gonna sound like a boomer but politics has become a joke now. I
 used to love it from like 2008-2018. The election cycle. Watching the 
news for updates. Supreme Court decision. Congressional hearings.
It’s hard to even follow now. Senate hearings are like 15 hours 
long about how Trump sucks. Or how democrats are making teenagers kill 
people. Whatever.
Trump makes it somewhat exciting at times but it’s far from what 
it used to be. This cabinet has so much turn around you have no idea 
what’s going on.
I guess most of you only know politics with Trump but there was a 
time where it was a fun thing to follow. 2016 was a very entertaining 
campaign. 2012 had great debates but Mitt Romney had too many 
“scandals.” And McCain was seen as a Warhawk and America was done with 
republicans in 2008.
MAGA, the election of Trump, the utter vitriolic hatred feels like
 a psychotic breakdown. The firing of scientists, gutting of welfare, 
regressing progress by many decades feels like self harm. USA is in a 
psychosis.
Trump and MAGA have caused so much chaos the last decade. I miss Obama.
Unfortunately politics is not a netflix special. It is not 
supposed to be entertainment. It is supposed to be information. And 
there is information there if you have the critical thinking skills; 
Lies are information too, if you can figure out what the lie is and why 
it was told.

[ceetwothree]: I’m going to drop this social psyche on you.
Your brain is looking for 3 things when it seeks information.
Accurate information. (Is this food poison).
The need to come to a quick “good enough” conclusion (what do I want to watch on TV).
The need to confirm what you already believe.  (Every post ever made on any social media platform ever).
What the posts are almost always doing is looking to be validated by their in group.
well that's not really productive for anyone. Good ideas will 
stand up under scrutiny and deserve to be scrutinized and questioned. If
 you can't explain why or ask it then you're just in it for the 
popularity. I remember someone on TikTok explaining why Narcissists love
 social movements, it allows them to be on the right side of history and
 the right side of things and center the conversation around them and 
how right they are. Anyone can say that what's happening in the Levant 
is shitty but if you can't explain why or go into the history then 
you're just saying grass is green.
Good ideas will stand up under scrutiny and deserve to be scrutinized and questioned
While I agree, I think you’re sort of neglecting the fact that the
 current state of politics in the US is what it is. As in, for a 
noninsignificant amount of people, “scrutiny” is not something that’s 
done in good faith and really isn’t what’s done at all because the 
desire isn’t to see if said good idea actually holds up, the desire is 
simply that said good idea be “wrong” if it doesn’t adhere to or even 
just somewhat fit into the dynamics of whatever in group the person on 
the other end ascribes to. Or there’s the reverse, where the desire is 
that an actually bad idea be “correct” because it adheres to said 
dynamics regardless of how bad an idea it may be or how unfounded its 
premise is (see conservatives running with Trump’s “they’re eating the 
dogs!” claim, or republicans jumping from being the party of the “free 
market” to attempting to justify Trump’s blanket tariffs)
If the person is engaging in the costly act of “seeking accurate information” then sure.
But a lot of the time people aren’t ,  it’s expensive at a calorie
 consumption level.   Disconfirming a belief costs more glucose ,  
confirming a belief is fee - literally - that’s just neurology.
And on social media ,  people are rarely seeking accurate 
information,  they are most often seeking social identification.  They 
want to say “hello tribe - I agree with your tropes about the enemy 
tribe ,  please love and accept me”.
That’s why you almost never “win” an argument on the internet.  
The goal for most people isn’t accurate information ,  it’s confirmation
 and social identification.  No amount of information will persuade 
somebody who isn’t seeking accurate information.
Yeah but that's just general terms. IRL you can just shoot them or seize power.

[Pleasant_Waltz_8280]: as youve identified it, many of our contemporary politics are in a
 kind of 'psychosis' behaviorally, in the sense that your beliefs are 
constantly artificially affirmed, and often you invent truth and mold it
 to fit your narrative. The internet, social media and the alienation we
 are subjected to only make this condition more extreme. I think that 
simply being productive and educated isnt enough, we have to examine new
 possibilities and ideas that carry the essence of the schizophrenic (in
 a deleuzian sense), to carve a space for a new form of politics that is
 disinterested in outdated ideas and is able to create a vision of the 
future.
I recommend reading a glossary of Deleuze & Guattari idea of 
schizoanalysis, i think its fundamental to understanding the current 
state of politics
I get my BA of History in a few months and I double majored in 
Polsci, I know a bit about politics at least enough to know how voters 
think. Still it doesn't stop me from thinking that people can and should
 educate themselves more on what they believe. Lest we get more idiots 
with mics and podcasts.
[JamesHenry627]: I get my BA of History in a few months and I double majored in 
Polsci, I know a bit about politics at least enough to know how voters 
think. Still it doesn't stop me from thinking that people can and should
 educate themselves more on what they believe. Lest we get more idiots 
with mics and podcasts.
[slothbuddy]: The problem is that most people don't actually know what educated 
looks like.  People strongly have a bias toward the status quo and 
believing that people always have good intentions.  So I don't know of 
any way to break through to people about how bad what's happening is 
until the whole thing is gone and they read about it in a history book.People are not as reasonable as they believe
[Accomplished_Pen980]: I have a serious question if someone wants to give a serious 
answer. Posts like this one are designed to make "establishment 
comments" like "Donald Trump is racist" and then qualify them with 
follow up like "and we know that to be true" which is a form of 
propaganda... when a single source makes an accusation and then 
qualifies it by assuming everyone agrees. It's the lowest form of 
salesmanship.
But with that said, the question I want to ask is, other than 
people telling you it's true and it must be true, what specifically is 
it that you personally know to be true that makes you believe Trump is 
racist? Keeping in mind that Obama deported more people than any other 
president to date, he was the "deporter in chief", drone struck anything
 that moved and built the detention cages Trump got blamed for. And 
Biden told insane stories about fighting with blacks on the mean streets
 of Delaware, associated with high ranking KKK members politically and 
told us in his own words that black kids were as smart as regular kids 
and that he didn't want his children growing up in an mixed race jungle 
for education.
Why would those facts about his contemporaries not characterize them as racist to you, but apply to him?
Of all the collective things Trump has done, good or bad, what stands out about him as racist in his field?
Why do you think deporting people or conducting drone strikes is 
something that qualifies Obama as racist? Especially when neither of 
these things were based on race?
Usually when people make comments about Trump’s racism they’re 
referring to his comments about immigrants poisoning the blood of 
America or about Haitian migrants eating cats and dogs which is entirely
 unfounded
But with that said, the question I want to ask is, other than 
people telling you it's true and it must be true, what specifically is 
it that you personally know to be true that makes you believe Trump is 
racist?

You always know someone is not very logical when they use the 
"this bad group supports this group, so the group they support is bad."That's
 not a rational conclusion, or at least here is no conclusion of value 
to draw from it. Like the black supremacist group supports Democrats... 
who cares? There are terrible people and groups that support every party
 in the US.

things, or for people who cater such people.

I genuinely wish Trump would go quietly about his doings. Not everything needs to be a major media spectacle.

deported as much people as Obama did in his eight years as president.

Hitler loaded people into cattle cars, kept them in concentration 
camps and exterminated them after starving them and publicly harming 
them, along with masochistic medical experiments.
I think you're diminishing the pain people went through under 
hitler by making a straight line comparison to a guy who deports people

Every time I open TikTok, my entire FYP feels like men vs. women 
content — podcasts arguing about dating standards, women talking about 
“bare minimum” behavior, men talking about “passport bros,” clips about 
cheating, red flags, expectations, “who should pay,” etc.
It feels like a never-ending gender war being pushed every single day.
For those of you who’ve noticed the same thing:Why do you think this type of content is blowing up so much?Is it just the algorithm pushing extremes?Are people genuinely this divided?Or is it just a loud minority?
Also, does this affect your real-life dating/view of the opposite gender, or do you ignore it as TikTok theatrics?
Curious what others think.

Lmao, exactly. This is a problem of their own creation.

[KrassKas]: Reset your algorithm. I don't see this happening at all.
[daKile57]: The oligarchs want men and women to hate each other, because it 
disarms the working-class. Fighting against the opposite sex is just 
fighting on behalf of the oligarchs in their quest to wipe out most of 
humanity.
[Lyclyn_816]: Delete TikTok
[Erevi6]: It's the algorithm - seeing extreme content tends to make people spend more time on the app.
When I started getting inundated with misogynists, I just searched
 a bunch of female-centric and feminist terms - 'feminism,' 'Andrea 
Dworkin,' 'abortion,' 'antinatalism,' etc - which solved the problem.
(For context, I'd only had TikTok for about a week by that point, 
and it seemed to think I was either a teenage boy or young man [I am 
extremely concerned if this is a 'normal' experience, given I hadn't 
searched for anything, clicked any links or gave it any indication to 
think I wanted to see extremist content])
It's also a huge part of the reason political discourse is so 
highly charged and toxic today. Everyone's algorithm is showing them 
extreme fringe outrage bait 24/7. On every platform.

[Lightsneeze2001]: It’s a for YOU page to be fair, I don’t see stuff like that ever. 
You have to be interacting, whether it’s liking or commenting, that 
brings it up that much in your algorithm.
[cornfarm96]: It isn’tthealgorithm, it’syouralgorithm. TikTok feeds you content that it thinks you want to see, based on the type of content you spend time watching.
[Winter_XwX]: It's being driven by a legitimate social problem. Gender relations
 have been getting worse and a lot of opportunistic charlatans have 
taken advantage of that to radicalize dispossessed and lonely men.
The issue is that some of these men feel that the literal only way
 in life to find fulfillment in life is to get a girlfriend and neglect 
to make any real meaningful connections because of that.
Then there's also the issue where women will have issues with the 
social dynamic between men and women and are generally much more wary 
around men broadly because of that but then men will take what is 
experienced by women as a social relation between to classes of people 
and internalize it in the worst way by immediately turning things like 
"I am wary around men" or "I would rather come across a wild bear than a
 strange man if I was alone and lost in the woods" and internalize these
 as being about them, seeing them as "women are wary around me" or 
"women would rather come across a bear in the woods than me" and then 
either handle it poorly by completely retreating and literally never 
approaching a woman or by lashing out and then just hating women or 
immediately start powerscaling the bear and the man and completely miss 
the point.
People posting that crap about the bear obviously imply that the 
strange man could be anyone, including YOU, thats why it ticks many guys
 off. They have people telling them that theyre potential murderers and 
rapists, and that they need to "control" something in order not to be. 
So if someone tells you that you should be uptight and collected around 
them all the time so as you wont risk being called toxic, abusive or a 
dangerous psychopath, then you protect your peace and stop being around 
the person who's fearful of you
See yeah thank you for directly illustrating my point
Women say that they are cautious around men because of the broader
 experience of interacting with men as a woman and how this behavior is 
kind of baked into the social dynamic so they tend to be more wary of it
 and then you have a piss baby diaper tantrum about how they're calling 
you a meanie evil rapist while also directly addressing the the man in 
the woods COULD BE ANYONE and then going "BUT BUT THEYRE SAYING THAT ITS
 MEEE"

[Tikkadude]: There are two main pushers.
Divisive content gets a lot of attention, and attention generates 
money through advertisements. Being controversial is profitable.
If people think the dating market is shit, which it kinda is right
 now, they'll stay inside using apps like TikTok more often.
So really there's only one pusher, which is just capitalism... Once again.
[Peach_Queen2345]: Skip the content. It will take itself out, eventually
[Commercial_Day_8341]: It is driven by people like you that watch it, start auto skipping any content related to it.
[Stiff_Stubble]: Don’t use TikTok. Don’t gotta deal with it.
[Hot_Assistant_6067]: I’m tired of it part of it is my fault im trying to change it to 
only music and travelling and just random facts I also find Brown Tok so
 toxic
[Ichoseguitar]: I don't use tiktok but I use twitter  ☹️ so it's kinda worse
[darkishere999]: My X algorithm was like this till I cleaned it up. What's harder 
for me to clean up at this point is all the Wignats and Groypers. Mainly
 the most vile low IQ lying propaganda pushing ones and anyone else 
pushing rage bait engagement farm on my feed which I've maybe a little 
at most success with.
[official_Bartard]: My FYP is UFC and boxing edits 🤷‍♂️
And cats forgot that one
[context_lich]: Not on tiktok, but I had seen a lot of content similar to this. I 
had to start leaving subreddits where it became common and using the 
"don't recommend me content from x" button.
It's designed to get you to continue interacting with the site. 
Real people in the real world usually hold more moderate opinions on 
gender and most women and men don't go around hating one another all the
 time. Overall I think we're better off just not engaging with it 
especially if it's upsetting you. I agree it can be upsetting. Sexism is
 wrong.
[Ok-Entrepreneur-8340]: Resetting ur app data might help, but I had to get off tik tok bc 
of stuff like this. There is not a doubt in my mind that the algorithm 
got messed with after it was shut down and brought back.
[Impossible_Active271]: It’s the same here
[Temporary_Copy3897]: your FYP is based on what content you have interact with before. 
my FYP has never shown me the type of content yours seems to be full of.
 just delete that account and make a new one
[BrainTotalitarianism]: Divide and conquer bro, elites always try to divide common people 
and make them fight each other while elites rob them while no one 
notices.
[pablonieve]: Promoted content is driven by engagement. Negative content drives 
the most engagement. Social media incentivizes toxic over positive to 
draw attention to ads.
[nnmmnmmnnm]: Recreate your account and don't interact with those posts. Don't even watch or look at comments.
[Poppetfan1999]: I don’t see those things on TikTok I mostly get kpop thirst traps and cat videos
[ImportanceLow7312]: Thats only you bud… i get terraria on mine
[Material_Policy6327]: It’s really only coming up to this degree if you let the fyp 
algorithm tune to it. Reality though is getting off social media as much
 as possible will help
[OtelDeraj]: Algorithms. My wife deleted her tiktok and created a new, anonymous one where she isreallychoosey about what she likes or interacts with, and she isn't getting 
exposed to nearly as much bs as she was before the reset. Algorithms 
feed you what they think you will interact with, and in doing so make it
 seem like there is only one kind of content on the platform when in 
reality there is still a lot outside of the one stupid thing they keep 
shoving down your throat.
[RayTheMaster]: It does'nt exist. The more you watch this content, the more you are shown this content.

Maybe I was just reclusive but during my grade school years 
(2008-2020), it seemed people like me who were nerdy about games beyond 
mainstream stuff like Minecraft/Call of Duty/etc and were terminally 
online had hard times fitting in socially due to our interests. The 
popular kids would rarely have any grasp of the stuff I was into. Now 
I'm seeing people younger than me into relatively esoteric things like 
Persona and DND and Ultrakill spending lots of time on Discord having 
large IRL friend groups and even girlfriends. What changed?
Did quarantine give people more free time to get introduced to 
niche things? Have the fast paced tailor made Tiktok algorithms helped 
more people develop more interests and given everyone their own unique 
taste?

Yup! It’s kind of like the Pareto Principle lol, it’s fractal…. It’s groups all the way down 😆 🐢
I mean, a good chunk of my grade school years were during the rise
 of social media yet it never felt like anyone else at school was as

I am very much aware that there is an algorithm that is present.
But tbh, i dont watch only what could be considered ''negative'' 
content. I am looking at all sorts of videos from video game RP, 
Christian, photography, talk shows or podcast or what ever to news 
content. Its mostly headlines saying something a long the lines 
''(insert topic) WHY YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED'' or something ''YOUR AN 
IDIOT IF YOU DONT BUY THIS'' or ''WATCH THIS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE'' or 
''WOMEN HATES THESE TYPES OF MEN'' or ''AI WILL SOON TAKE OVER AND 
DESTROY THE WORLD. ESPECIALLY YOU''
I am seriously scrolling and scrolling and its just pure insanity on my feed at the moment.
I find it super hard to actually find new content that i enjoy now
 a days. Maybe im easily bored. The algorithm sucks and i know i am 
putting to much energy and focus on youtube. I should go out more.
Is someone else experiencing the same?

Anyone else feeling totally exhausted by social media?
Between the pressure to always respond, constantly compare 
ourselves, and keep up with everything online, it’s no wonder so many of
 us are feeling burned out. What used to be fun or a way to stay 
connected now feels like a never-ending performance.
And let’s be real: for most under 30, platforms like TikTok, 
YouTube, and Instagram have replaced the news. But instead of facts, we 
get what the algorithm thinks will trigger emotion. That means less 
knowledge, more opinions—and a rise in conspiracy content.
But here's a thought: what if the future of social media is actuallyin our hands?
More creators are choosingethical influencing—
focusing on truth, value, and purpose over pure attention. People are 
building followings not just to sell products, but to share ideas, 
educate, coach, consult, or spread awareness for causes they care about.
 It’s not just big influencers anymore. Anyone can grow something real 
and meaningful.
Maybe the mindset shift we need is this:
👉 Stop just consuming—start creating.👉 Don’t just scroll—post something that matters to you.👉 Use social media to express your values, your voice, your mission.
I’ve been inspired by purpose-driven projects likeReduceCO2Now.com.
 When your message isn’t about you, but about something bigger, the 
pressure actually goes away. You always have something meaningful to 
say.
In the end, social media is here to stay. But the big question is:
Will it keep draining us—or can it finally empower us?
Curious how others feel.Have you tried creating instead of just consuming?Does it help—or just add to the pressure?

Non chronological timelines were designed to be a harm that

Is it just me, or has anyone else been getting a ton of right-wing
 tweets on their timeline lately? I don’t interact with political stuff 
and lean more to the left, so I have no clue why my feed is suddenly 
full of this. I’m on Twitter for funny and relatable posts, not 
politics, but now my whole timeline is bumming me out.
It’s like every post is right-wing, even from accounts I’ve never 
seen or followed—like I got a tweet from Donald Trump, and I’ve never 
followed or interacted with anything like that. Worst part, I’m even 
seeing full-blown racist stuff (I muted a post about "date a black 
person or the electric chair" with a picture of someone being 
electrocuted).
It’s weird because muting these posts doesn’t help. The more I 
mute, the more similar ones pop up. Is this an Elon thing? Is anyone 
else dealing with this, or is my algorithm just broken?

[Maximum-Country-149]: I have no idea (I'm not on Twitter), but by my understanding most of the left-wing creators left Twitter some time ago.
[royberry333]: Cant remember the name, but theres a website that live tracks 
social media bias. Pretty much all platforms were left leaning, except 
for twitter/x, which was far leaning.
[arcticbuzz]: It pushes content from premium users who pay for their blue 
checkmark. I think the overlap between right wingers and blue checkmark 
users is pretty high.
[sickxgrrrl]: It’s been proven algorithms are designed to specifically push this
 stuff on male users. Within minutes of a man signing up on social media
 those posts are boosted to land on your home page. The longer you 
linger the more you’ll see. The best thing to do is make burner accounts
 where you sign up as a woman to scroll and or keep saying you aren’t 
interested when that bullshit pops up.
[Itchy_Hospital2462]: Honestly, twitter is only going to get worse. The more people who 
leave, the better. Unfortunately, the alternatives aren't super 
compelling yet, but over time I think things like blue sky will suck 
less and less until they're just what twitter used to be.
At this point, the machine exists to make you angry and/or afraid,
 and for no other purpose. Elon doesn't need to make money from twitter 
(and he's not, revenue is through the floor), so ask yourself what other
 sort of utility he could derive from it.
Meta-owned platforms are a sort of gray area because they need to 
remain profitable, but if you're going to leave twitter, might as well 
leave the broligarchy entirely.

[Special_EDy]: If the majority voted for Trump, then the majority of social-media posts should be right leaning.
You are just accustomed to social media either censoring 
wrongthink, or only showing you content which aligns with your own 
biases.
You are likely seeing a more accurate representation on Twitter than other sites.
Just a reminder: the majority didn't vote for him.
Less than a third of eligible voters voted for Trump. More than a third of eligible voters didn't vote.
People who aren't right-wingers have been filtering off of twitter
 for over a year, so the remaining population is heavily skewed to the 
right. This is basic math -- come on, you're smarter than this.
The majority of voters did vote for Trump, that's a factual 
statement without you trying to put a spin on it, that's why he is 
president and not Kamala, that's how democracy works.
The country has a right leaning bias at the moment. Most of social
 media has a very left leaning bias. If there isn't any manipulation 
from the parent company, in theory any platform should be fairly close 
to center and evenly divided, perhaps with a slight skew to the right, 
as this would be representative of the population.
Twitter is probably theclosestto accurate. It should be
 close to 50/50, reddit sure isn't. Maybe YouTube is, but that's simply 
because its algorithm is so good at feeding you content you agree with.
Trump didn't get a majority of the vote.
Really, why is he president?
…is this a serious question?
Because the electoral college determines who wins the presidency, 
and state winners are determined based on plurality vote, not majority.
Plurality = more votes than any other single option. Majority = over 50% of the votes.
Even if the popular vote determined the presidency (which it does 
not): Trump got 49.8% of the popular vote (vs 48.3% Harris) which is not
 a majority.
A majority (50.2%) voted for someone other than Trump.
And that’s not even considering the 36% of voters who didn’t vote.
 Put them in there and Trump won about ~31.9% of the eligible voting 
population.
I never said the majority votes for Trump, I said * "if the majority voted for Trump"*.
You lose, try harder next time you move the goalposts.
This you?

https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1i8lkd4/comment/m8y2pcu/
No, that was another personu/special_edy
Trump is more popular than Kamala. Social media should be more positive towards the right than the left as a result.
I guess you’re the one moving the goalposts.
Anyways, on the social media point - no, the majority of social media users shouldn’t be Trump supporters.
First of all, social media isn’t representative. It’s skewed 
heavily younger than the general populace, for one. There is zero sense 
in which social media presents an accurate microcosm of our world.
Even if it did, though:
Trump got 49.8% of the vote from the ~64% of voters who voted. He 
currently has a 46.5% approval rating, 48% disapproval (538 average). So
 already anywhere that has majority pro-Trump sentiment is inaccurately 
biased towards him.
It actually shouldn’t even be 50/50! Social media is an 
international medium, and large majorities of the rest of the world’s 
populace doesn’t trust in Trump:https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/06/11/confidence-in-donald-trump/
So: if social media were truly representative of our world then it’d be something like 65% anti-Trump.
You’re citing the votes of 74 million Americans to declare that 
social media sites used by hundreds of millions across the globe should 
be 50/50 pro / anti Trump. That’s not how either social media or math 
works.
Between this and not understanding how our elections 
are decided you’ve very confidently claimed some very obviously 
incorrect things. I want to gently suggest that you do some listening 
and learning.
Google AI says that 70% of Americans use social media.
Trump was 2 thousandths away from 50% of the vote, you're 
absolutely splitting hairs by picking that as your hill to die on. It's 
irrelevant to the entire point I made anyways. He got more votes than 
Kamala, that doesn't matter either, the point is that the population is 
surprisingly close to evenly split on politics. Nobody is saying 
anything about social media being 0.2% right leaning or whatever.
If you scroll through reddit, you'll probably find that nearly all
 trending posts are left leaning. 80%, 90%, 99%? This is not 
representative of reality. Old Twitter was the same way. New Twitter (X)
 is definitely not perfectly representative of the American population, 
no social media is, but even if it is heavily right leaning it is likely
 closer to center than reddit or old Twitter. And center is where the 
USA population is.
My dude Americans are 341 million people out of 8 billion people 
in the world. That's less than 5%. The internet is a global thing and 
the world disapproves of Trump at a nearly 2:1 rate.
If someone is seeing 50:50 opinions on Trump - oops, that's quite biased towards him.
I don't even know what point you're trying to make at this point. 
Nobody has said social media represents reality. It doesn't. Learn about
 how our elections work, do some basic math on the claims you're making,
 and stop moving goalposts.
Are you also upset that there are very few 70+ year olds on 
Reddit? Or that Facebook severely underrepresents China, the second most
 populous nation on earth? Or that Twitter doesn't have a proportional 
amount of illiterate people when compared to the global literacy rate?
None of them reflect reality! Really makes you think!!

currently has a 46.5% approval rating, 48% disapproval (538 average). So
 already anywhere that has majority pro-Trump sentiment is inaccurately 
biased towards him.
It actually shouldn’t even be 50/50! Social media is an 
international medium, and large majorities of the rest of the world’s 
populace doesn’t trust in Trump:https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/06/11/confidence-in-donald-trump/
So: if social media were truly representative of our world then it’d be something like 65% anti-Trump.
You’re citing the votes of 74 million Americans to declare that 
social media sites used by hundreds of millions across the globe should 
be 50/50 pro / anti Trump. That’s not how either social media or math 
works.
Between this and not understanding how our elections 
are decided you’ve very confidently claimed some very obviously 
incorrect things. I want to gently suggest that you do some listening 
and learning.
Google AI says that 70% of Americans use social media.
Trump was 2 thousandths away from 50% of the vote, you're 
absolutely splitting hairs by picking that as your hill to die on. It's 
irrelevant to the entire point I made anyways. He got more votes than 
Kamala, that doesn't matter either, the point is that the population is 
surprisingly close to evenly split on politics. Nobody is saying 
anything about social media being 0.2% right leaning or whatever.
If you scroll through reddit, you'll probably find that nearly all
 trending posts are left leaning. 80%, 90%, 99%? This is not 
representative of reality. Old Twitter was the same way. New Twitter (X)
 is definitely not perfectly representative of the American population, 
no social media is, but even if it is heavily right leaning it is likely
 closer to center than reddit or old Twitter. And center is where the 
USA population is.
My dude Americans are 341 million people out of 8 billion people 
in the world. That's less than 5%. The internet is a global thing and 
the world disapproves of Trump at a nearly 2:1 rate.
If someone is seeing 50:50 opinions on Trump - oops, that's quite biased towards him.
I don't even know what point you're trying to make at this point. 
Nobody has said social media represents reality. It doesn't. Learn about
 how our elections work, do some basic math on the claims you're making,
 and stop moving goalposts.
Are you also upset that there are very few 70+ year olds on 
Reddit? Or that Facebook severely underrepresents China, the second most
 populous nation on earth? Or that Twitter doesn't have a proportional 
amount of illiterate people when compared to the global literacy rate?
None of them reflect reality! Really makes you think!!
[10catsinspace]: …is this a serious question?
Because the electoral college determines who wins the presidency, 
and state winners are determined based on plurality vote, not majority.
Plurality = more votes than any other single option. Majority = over 50% of the votes.
Even if the popular vote determined the presidency (which it does 
not): Trump got 49.8% of the popular vote (vs 48.3% Harris) which is not
 a majority.
A majority (50.2%) voted for someone other than Trump.
And that’s not even considering the 36% of voters who didn’t vote.
 Put them in there and Trump won about ~31.9% of the eligible voting 
population.
I never said the majority votes for Trump, I said * "if the majority voted for Trump"*.
You lose, try harder next time you move the goalposts.
This you?
The majority of voters did vote for Trump, that's a factual 
statement without you trying to put a spin on it, that's why he is 
president and not Kamala, that's how democracy works.

No, that was another personu/special_edy
Trump is more popular than Kamala. Social media should be more positive towards the right than the left as a result.
I guess you’re the one moving the goalposts.
Anyways, on the social media point - no, the majority of social media users shouldn’t be Trump supporters.
First of all, social media isn’t representative. It’s skewed 
heavily younger than the general populace, for one. There is zero sense 
in which social media presents an accurate microcosm of our world.

TÍTULO: Most of these posts make me sad. : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I'm not sure if it's the algorithm, but I feel like every time I 
see a post from this subreddit, it's about not making friends, 
struggling to find a job, or being unable to find a significant other, 
etc. It's to the point that whenever I see a title that insinuates life 
is terrible, I assume it's from this subreddit. Interestingly, I'm 
usually right, funny enough. The pessimism I see is saddening, but 
perhaps it's just my algorithm at work.

[Feeling-Currency6212]: It’s rough out here in 2025 man. It took me 5 months to get a new job. A lot of people are hurting right now.
The only job i can get right now is at a call center its so tragic
Look on the bright side. You can get A job, whereas many people can’t.
Count your blessings.
$6,458.74 / year is not a blessing, but it's a start
If you’re living independently, that’s an offensively paltry 
salary. If you’re living with roommates or family, you can manage.
The call center job could be a stepping stone for better jobs.
yep pretty much, its not a job you can take on and expect to survive alone

[11SomeGuy17]: 1 You think happy people are gonna spend time posting on a generational subreddit?
2 A lot of countries are becoming worse places to live overall and
 have been for a while but now it's getting to a point where basic 
things like food and housing are struggles so it's only natural that 
you'll see more negativity.
Take these 2 factors together and it makes sense.
Maybe I am naive, but I don’t understand why food insecurity is 
even a problem in the US. It’s the wealthiest country on the planet. It 
doesn’t make sense to me.
Food scarcity wouldn't exist anywhere on earth if it was only a 
matter of capacity to produce or otherwise obtain food. The country is 
rich, rich in resources, we have many very wealthy businesses, very 
wealthy business owners, however the workers are extremely poor. 
Unionization is nearly non-existent, workers have few rights (in my 
state we don't even have mandatory break laws so jobs don't need to give
 you any sort of rest, just pure work), and prices for everything is 
absurdly high because it's all privatized and those private businesses 
use the government to create situations that let them raise prices 
further.
The country is rich as in a lot of wealth is here, it's just all 
owned by a small group of a few thousand people. Everyone else owns very
 little.

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I’ve been trying to preach about this for the longest and it seems
 to not catch steam but I’ll try again since the topic is relevant again
 and people are looking for perspectives. I’ll start this out by saying 
that I’m a 24 year old Gen Z Black man, so my experiences may not be 
applicable to everyone but I do think it’s mostly universal for most men
 in different ways and extremes.
The culture I grew up in was a very conservative one. I wasn’t 
allowed to cry as a child or else I’d get beaten for it. I was made fun 
for having a high pitched voice late into childhood by my own family 
members and was seen as lame due to being into academics and reading by 
my fellow classmates. I got bullied pretty bad up until high school 
because I wasn’t aggressive enough to the people who were targeting me. 
This would happen from both men and women in my life and didn’t fully 
end until I was in college. I was expected to be hyper masculine and 
just didn’t fit into any of the expectations that people around me 
wanted me to fit into.
Around high school I started to feel insecure about my lack of a 
romantic relationship. I was never a conservative but I would listen to 
YouTubers such as ShoeonHead, SomeBlackGuy, Chris Ray Gun, and a few 
others. Eventually I found my myself deeper into the algorithm that 
would push more and more right wing content to me about how to attract 
women and it made sense to me even as a leftist since nothing I did ever
 worked and the men I saw that were successful were also harboring a lot
 of the same traits that red pill YouTubers were. I wanted to be more 
like them but I still held a lot of left wing beliefs and just couldn’t 
get all the way into the most toxic opinions about women.
In 2015, I was introduced to a brand new version of the left 
through Bernie Sanders and a group of creators who weren’t as annoying 
as the Obama era liberals when it came to discussing social issues. I 
learned more and more about the toxic roles of masculinity and how it 
held us back from being who we truly are. This is a toxic expectation 
that is held by both men and women in society and shapes how men feel 
like they need to perform in order to impress the women around them. I 
rejected that attitude and took the route of self happiness. I decided 
that I’d rather be alone and happy than perform hyper masculinity to 
meet some toxic expectations from people I didn’t even like. I started 
to meet some women who didn’t expect me to meet those expectations and 
my entire view of the world changed. I think we have a major problem 
with how we expect men to act positive yet still hold extremely 
conservative views of men when it comes to their role in society and 
their role in dating and more men have to break themselves out of this 
cycle completely. It’s okay to be single and happy and while I still 
think it’s hard to find women who don’t expect this kind of masculinity 
while dating, some do exist out there and I’m certain I will meet a 
woman who loves me for who I am. Don’t make yourself miserable for the 
pleasure of others.

Gen Z goes from 1997-2012. A generation isn't based on vibes.
there are multiple definitions that’s start from 1995 or 1996 and end late 2000s to early 2010s

[biiabadoobee]: 2010 and up is way more accurate. I was born in 2008 and I don’t 
see any difference between how I was raised and how my brother, who was 
born in 2004, or my cousin, who was born in 2007, were raised. I wasn’t 
born immersed in technology, I clearly remember when smartphones became a
 thing. I remember it was really rare to see someone with one (and they 
were still those tiny Samsung phones), and I used to call them “finger 
phones” lol. Phones only became a normal thing and stopped being 
relatively new and a luxury when I was in 6th or 7th grade. I spent my 
childhood without technology, playing outside, and technology/the 
internet only became a thing when I was becoming a teenager. I think 
people born in 2010 were already kids with technology, while those of us
 born before had a childhood without it.

change based on your opinion.
Gen Z born 2000 or so and on have only known a world with not just
 the internet, but one where social media is king. Being born into 
ANYTHING means "this is my world, this is how it is" and accepting it 
and learning how to live inside of it.
Well, social media has been something that it seems like no one is
 really taking seriously in terms of understanding what it means for Gen
 Z.
To be raised in a space where you can block anything you don't 
like, where the algorithm provides you everything you desire over and 
over and over again...Where you can sit in this world and just be fed 
all of your wants and desires...
Where you can shape your image exactly how you want, use the 
filters, look like someone else entirely and crave the attention of 
likes and clicks...it all gets the dopamine going.
But what is is DOING to a generation?
In the real world:
You have people who see little need for confrontation. Why 
confront? Why be uneasy? Just don't deal with those emotions. Push them 
away, move away from the problem.
This builds anxiety and fear, but what else? Where are the coping 
mechanisms? How do you cope when all you have known is to block that 
which you do not like?
Everything works. If the internet simply works, if your iphone 
simply works, how do you know how to fix anything? Why are older 
generations showing this generation how to fix tech stuff? Why is it not
 more the other way around? Sure, maybe you help grandma use apply pay, 
but then your uncle shows you how to run the router and set up the 
internet. Why?
This is a generation that, online, has everything easily handed to
 them and they don't have to reach for what they like. But in the real 
world, it is tough and there is less out there, and they are terrified 
of the interactions that are known as "adversity".
I have noticed though that there is an underlying sense of "fuck 
that politically correct shit" too, going back to their Gen X parents. 
More slurs that were around in the 90s are back in these circles.
There is something simmering underneath. Similar to Gen X with the
 angst that you could see in a movie like Fight Club. But this....Is 
different. It's not an awakening. It is something else.
There are pros and cons to every generation. Gen Z will be fine like everybody else.
But I DO wonder how they will figure it out from social media and on.

[SaxDemonSJS]: I definitely do not feel like I only ever knew a world with social
 media tbh. I remember people talking about myspace sometimes when 
younger but I don't think social media really took off until I was in 
5th or 6th grade. Everyone was making a Facebook account and I felt 
major FOMO. That was just my experience though, it can vary obviously.
I don't think social media really took off until I was in 5th or 6th grade.
that is pretty much what I mean. Not from the womb. But from when 
you start developing who you are. Middle school and on. And full on in 
HS everything was social media. You guys are the first to be raised with
 that in this way, and it matters. You gained some stuff and lost some 
stuff because of it. I find it all pretty interesting IMO>
Honestly, I was and still am one of those weird people that never 
has had a serious social media account (besides reddit if you count 
that). I have instagram but only to talk to my sister and a few others. I
 never have posted anything or documented my life on there or anywhere 
though. However, I know this is the exception. It was very odd seeing 
everyone around me in middle school get instagram and become so attached
 to their smartphones
I can appreciate that. I do wonder how that has affected your 
peers, being on insta in middle school and always on their phones like 
this. As if social media is "real" and followers "matter". I've talked 
to people that are VERY involved in their "image" and they seem to 
totally buy into social media as an extension of real life.

[Archivist2016]: We're too early for these. Like I know a lot of people my age 
would get phones/electronic devices at 10, even then most would still 
not be using it enough to be "raised by it". Maybe try with Gen Alpha?
Raised on it. Not like it literally raised you with nothing else. 
But like, it was your natural setting of life. For those before you, 
they knew something different as the norm. But that was your norm. So 
that is raised on it, raised with it, etc. Social media is a natural 
normal way of life. For me? I came to see social media as a tool, much 
like a hammer. Its waaay different. Not better or worse, but different.
Are you from my gen? I think of social media as... something that 
requires a lot of effort but it's often kinda on a shallow/surface 
level.

I think one of most important things Gen Z can develop is empathy, genuine kindness, and respect.
I understand Gen Z have their own struggles too. That's why 
finding a hobby and having a supportive circle can be really helpful 
during hard times, or if not then self-care and a few goodqualityfriends.

I built Moodie as a reaction to how exhausting social media can 
be. It's an anonymous 1:1 chat app that's all about connecting based on 
how you feel. It's the old-school habit of just chatting, but without 
the baggage of profiles, posts, and 'clout.'
We just hit 420 users, and the community is super positive. It's 
not about big numbers; it's about the quality of the conversations. If 
you're tired of the performance and the algorithm, maybe this is for 
you.

Hey, so I’ve noticed a lot of people around my age (21) and older 
are listing their various mental disorders in their bios on socials. It 
reminds me of the TikTok Covid era tbh. Has anyone else noticed this?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[devil652_]: Yeah. Usually its "self diagnosed"
Mental disorders and illnesses have become a new trend where young
 people (and sadly old millennials) are trying to be unique, stand out, 
express their individuality, etc
It's usually people who dont have interesting personalities so 
they have to make up for it by pretending to have mental illnesses as if
 that's the new hip and cool fad
I miss when emos were the cool thing. They were at least attractive
The worst part is that I actually have OCD, and it’s not quirky either. When it was at its worst I wanted to die
I have high functioning autism and it's not quirky or cool. We 
often bullied, ostracized, compared to Chris Chan, mocked, ridiculed etc
 especially by the far right the far left wants to fit us into their cup
 holders and many of them have been self diagnosed. Young and old are 
sick of. If you can't develop a personality or hobbies be boring but 
leave the diagnosed alone and the diagnosing to the professionals.
To be fair autism is super undiagnosed, and considering the state 
of American healthcare I don’t really blame anyone for not going to a 
psychologist or psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis.
Autism also spans such a massive diaspora of people that the 
average person is pretty stupid when it comes to talking about autism. 
There are some people that unironically act like it’s the worst thing 
that could happen to their kid when there are thousands of people with 
autism that live perfectly fulfilling lives.
At the end of the day it’s just ignorance, like many of the things that make the lives of a minority group harder.

sexuality or religion are lame people. No one gives a single fuck. For a
 lot of people, it’s all they have. So they run with that. They don’t 
have anything that makes them interesting.
The worst thing is the need to actually be "interesting" to begin 
with. Plenty of people are naturally quite plain and boring, and that's 
okay. That doesn't mean they don't have any character or personality. 
The world needs those kinds of people. Often times they end up being the
 most special and valued by others because they lay the foundation for 
everyone else. In reality at the end of the day no one cares about how 
much of a spectacle you can make, they just care about your character.
I agree with you. But those people also have unique qualities that
 make them interesting. I also respect the fact that they are just 
themselves without feeling the need to conform to some identity. Like we
 see with groups I mentioned earlier.
I’m bi and most of my friends from school are lgbtq. I did make 
that a fairly big part of my personality as a teenager, but it’s sad to 
see grown adults doing it. Ofc if they’re newly out it’s understandable 
and with sexuality etc it can be a bit more complicated, but the people 
who become seriously obsessed with labels usually do lack personality
I agree. It’s a small part of what makes someone who they are 
overall. I can go the other way too though. For example, I’m a straight 
male and I had some friends in college that legit only talked about 
girls and sex. It’s got to the point where we’re like bro stfu.

But it's taboo to call them out because they will use the "you're being toxic" or "you're not a neurologist" defense.
But, trust me,  aREALhigh functioning autistic person can sniff out their own kind without much trouble.
Having a niche interest, posting on 4chan or Reddit,  or being

themselves autistic, or who are antisocial but chronically online. I 
don’t even have ASD and the meme was funny first time now it’s very

TÍTULO: Social media is not the problem. Algorithms and monetization are. : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
It's no surprise that the modern generation is facing a serious 
and unprecedented mental health crisis. In the wake of this said crisis,
 there has been a movement to cancel social media, in an attempt to help
 salvage mental health. However, I really do not think social media is 
the issue here, and for those who are more socially awkward, social 
media has actually been more of a blessing than a curse.
Back before the internet, there was a thing called "pen-pals". 
This is where complete strangers who have never met in real life, often 
due to living in different parts of the country, would build a long 
distance relationship with one another by writing letters to one 
another. Social media is a similar concept, except for the fact that one
 no longer has to wait over a series of weeks or even months for a 
reply, and there's more of a state of consistent converse just as those 
would talk to one another in real life. Social media friends are the 
21st Century pen-pals, and it's been a good thing.
The problem is not social media. It's algorithms and monetization.
 The fact that certain sensationalist content, often promoting a certain
 political or sociological message, of which stirs up certain negative 
emotions in one person, is promoted by the algorithm in order to help 
the user make more money off of their content, or to be able to sell 
more of your data with you obsessing over a certain topic out of a 
negative emotion. The user DarkMatter2525 covered this in depth in his 
video "You Are Lied to Every Day".
Social media used to be an advanced pen-pal service. YouTube in 
its early days was simply a place where people shared skating videos, 
vlogs, skits, plush videos, sprites, gaming videos, etc., where they 
simply shared their creative minds with other creative minds. Sure, 
there was still a lot of bad behavior back then, but it was still mostly
 apolitical, and bad behavior was able to be moderated on one's channel 
or videos by certain users, via deleting comments or blocking the user.
Now however, social media has been used as a platform by bad 
businesses. Your data is profitable, and companies want to sell as much 
of it as they can, so the algorithms of these social media sites promote
 certain sensationalist pieces of media to stir up negative emotion that
 creates a state of obsession that keeps one on social media longer, 
therefore creating more data to sell. There's too many sensationalist 
fake news articles, ones that cherry and nut pick certain statistics, 
often putting them out of context, sometimes even accompanying them with
 strawman memes such as the shitty Soyjak VS Chad meme in order to shut 
down an apposing argument via charisma and blowhard behavior. This is 
happening on both the left and the right, and even to a lesser extent 
within fringe centrist circles. The problem is the bathwater, not the 
baby.
I say the correct approach to this mental health crisis is not to 
get rid of social media, but to try to adopt the mental approach of 
social media being a virtual pen-pal system, and only using it for these
 services, of making friends across the world, of sharing your creative 
mind with other creative minds, and blocking off political or 
sociological echo-chamber content, because it's not helping make the 
world a better place. What happens on the political or sociological 
level is beyond our control, and nothing we rant about on the internet 
is going to change people's minds and make pipe-dreams come true, even I
 understand that this thread of mine is only going to reach a small 
amount of people, I just feel like reaching some is better than reaching
 none. Social media is not the problem, the problem is that people are 
using social media the wrong way.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[[deleted]]: I used to be anti-social media until I realized one thing - I was 
using the platforms for the wrong purpose. Many Gen Z people, myself 
included for a long time, use(d) social media as a gateway for fame. 
They care about the numbers more than they really should, and thus it 
leads to lots of anxiety. When I did content creation as a teen, I felt 
this pressure a lot.
I found that one of the best ways to enjoy being social online is 
to use the platforms for more organic connection, stuff like how the 
most basic of internet users use Facebook for family reasons. 
Interestingly, it was not any of the social media giants that made me 
realize this, but instead it was the Fediverse/Mastodon. People flocked 
to it as a substitute for Twitter, but when I tried it out, I fell in 
love with it more due to the environment being much closer to a more 
grounded and level-headed Twitter. One of its big upsides - reach 
doesn't mean shit and organic connection does.
The only I will have to slightly disagree with on the OP is the 
political points. I think politics are a necessary evil albeit 
discussion of such on the internet is extremely touchy. Political 
discussion is one of the few things I try to stay away from on the 
internet in general, especially Reddit, and I leave it to debates in 
real life. That said, many people use platforms as a tool for activism, 
and frankly that's their preference, not mine, and I won't judge.
On a slightly related note, in recent years I've grown interested 
in aspects of older internet. Not things like "free speech"/wild west 
days, or strong bigotry, but more things like self-hosting and websites.
 It ties into the personal data point mentioned in the OP. I've been 
trying to make my own blog website completely out of HTML/CSS coding for
 opinions and write-ups that I normally wouldn't share on 
Reddit/Twitter/etc. and because I prefer writing over setting it up as a
 video essay for something like YouTube.
I think a lot of Gen Z should realize that fame on the internet 
isn't everything, but it doesn't hurt if you do want to pursue it or end
 up such way unintentionally. It's really a to each their own thing of 
how you want to use the internet, provided it's not for entirely 
malicious intent. What I will say is that when I shifted my views on 
social media, being on the internet became much more enjoyable for me.
[cancerousking]: It might not be the problem but it is a problem as those algorithms would not exist without social media
[Calm-poptart97]: Algorithms are why i tell people all the time to be careful what 
they view on social media since any interaction even just viewing a 
piece of content makes the algorithms think that you want to see more of
 it.
It’s an interesting idea since you can mold what you want to see 
online, but it can also serve as an echo chamber for negative & 
harmful content.
A good example of this is the instagram explore page or suggested tweets.
Making friends online is also a challenge today, especially in 
gaming because it seems like a lot of people are just trying to reach 
the monetization requirements.
I kinda want more of the social aspect of social media instead of just treating everyone like a fan
Most people don't have true friends. Most people naturally form 
groups that align with their beliefs or brains and forms a collective 
conscious where they just talk to themselves like schizophrenic incels. 
True relationships are hard most people can only manage one meaningful 
relationship.
Agreed, quality>quantity

social media being a virtual pen-pal system
Isn't that the same as going back to pre-social media? We had all that stuff
[[deleted]]: No. You’re wrong.
We as individuals ARE THE PROBLEM.
We as human beings are TOXIC
we as human beings are NEGATIVE
Do you know what my algo feed looks like? Its akin to sunshine 
because Iam a genuine positive happy person, so I metaphysically look 
for happy and positive things.
Like attracts like… no?
[realPidge]: That's the first thought I had. Maybe it's the algorithms? 
Algorithms control everything if you think about it surface level. But 
then you realize this is all just natural progression of humanity and 
the capitalist system. The commercialization of our identities. Shop 
around discover new fake people. Subscribe to an ideology you don't care
 about. Defend ideas you don't care about. And when you log off 
everything seems pointless like you just watched a movie and you feel 
aimless. What's the purpose of real world again?
It's almost like you're radicalizing yourself the more you use the
 internet you become more accustomed to the conventions of the internet 
and forget that there are real world local issues you need to fix in 
order to progress in life. You can't just forget that unless you were 
born on the internet. You're allowing the large corporations to use you 
and sell you. You're allowing yourself to consume random propaganda and 
naively believing in it. And because it's all you know you don't know 
the true intent or what you should actually care about they remove your 
value system and tell you that who cares what you do with your time 
people waste it all the time on other crap like Fortnite so you're not 
technically wasting time on social media random rationalizing that's 
unproductive. Then when you realize this it's too late.
There's always going to be problems to fix just be honest with yourself. Go crazy.
Btw now they're trying to create a program to give you the most 
optimal value system that alights to your predispositions. So now you 
don't have to work to know what you want? See this isn't right. The 
"boomers" were right all along.
The ones at the top don't care about you. It's about the money 
(and if at some point they did care they forgot along the way why they 
were chasing money and power it's a long journey to save all of 
humanity) and some who think they're doing good are only trying to keep 
up a public image (real things they have said that no one pays attention
 to: "people are so naive..." "If enough people think you're a genius 
then you are a genius" "zoomers are really stupid"). This is now no 
reason to sugar coat it.
[[deleted]]: It’s more that ppl let the status of influencers get to them. 
Influencer, president, cop, citizen, they’re still ppl at the end of the
 day and no different than u
[Weasel_the3rd]: Yup companies invest so much to see what clicks and keeps you 
addicted. Hence why our timelines are not set to show you the newest 
posts by default.

Hey, just letting you all know, I've been on tiktok and douyin 斗音 
(basically the Chinese tiktok) for a while, since 2020, but stopped for a
 bit and came back to use it again now.
It's been pushing a lot of propaganda at me lately, which hasn't 
happened before. Pro Trump, Pro Chinese, Pro Communist, Anti American, 
Anti Capitalist. A lot of #ilovechina content, and a lot of inner 
mongolia content as well with the same soundtracks everytime.
I just wanted to let you know, because despite what gen z likes to
 call themselves as "not susceptible to propaganda", this means that you
 are definitely more susceptible to it, let's be honest here, 
considering I've seen people say they get their news exclusively from 
tiktok and cite utterly nonsense history from their "source". Which is 
concerning.
Since I hang out on the chinese internet, I don't usually interact
 with chinese content on tiktok, I just look at douyin. Nor do I ever 
interact with politics on tiktok either. It's definitely being pushed. 
No doubt about it.
I'm on B站 (Bilibili) and 微博 (Weibo) a lot. Chinese people love 
Trump, so I think that's why they're really pushing for him. They've 
also been stopping me from even saying "Chinese Propaganda" in a tiktok 
comment.
Look, if you agree with this shit, whatever. I don’t care. But at 
least be aware that this is propaganda, and Tiktok is a vehicle for it, 
and that many of you are in denial about it.

[SciGuy013]: I just downloaded it. I have spent the last 30 minutes blocking everything because it’s all been propaganda
[BIPS2000]: I can't speak for anyone else, but I definitely see far more 
content critical of China than supportive of it. Lots of videos talking 
about Tiananmen Square, uyghurs, Taiwan, etc.
There certainly is foreign propaganda and it's always important to
 stay vigilant, but I don't think Tiktok is uniquely bad in that regard.
 Not uniquely good either mind you, just not bad. Especially when 
compared to Facebook.
that’s the thing about propaganda though, their intention isn’t to
 make americans love china. the intention is to disrupt the US elections
they just want division. just because you’re seeing anti china

You are correct that its a broad social media issue, but TikTok 
has lots of kids, so they are even more vulnerable to disinformation 
campaigns.
There's a key difference between Reddit news and Tik tok news. 
Reddit culture and programming encourage users to cite sources with 
links in regards to tall enough claims. If you cant, youre deas in the 
water. Tik tok doesnt hold users to the same standards
yes, Influencers will typically green screen in a snippet of the 
related article; however that gives viewers a false sense of 
credibility. The illusion makes impressionable/young viewers think "this
 influencer did their proper research and is telling me the 'real' 
truth" as a result, theyre significantly less likely to verify the 
story.
Actual news reporters and journalists on Tik tok typically link 
their credentials and directly say they're doing it for fun/more 
creative freedom because they want people to be informed out of sync 
with their affiliated news outlet. Thats fine; typically medical 
influencers do this as well.
A major difference between a true news outlet and a regular 
influencer is adherence to standards. Actual news outlets are legally 
obligated to make sure they're telling the truth or at least have 
sources to say "we thought we were correct, but we'll post a redaction 
with new evidence". Influencers arent bound by this and can effectively 
spread as much misinformation as they can get away with. This is why 
some go for smaller stories that arent picked up by bigger outlets; they
 can vamp the story for more engagement.
The most an influencer has to lose is the video getting taken down or being banned.

Yes, let me fetch the internal emails and communities from president Xi for you.

To think any apps /company can push anything that’s not aligned with Chinese government is silly.

Well about half of your tax dollars goes to a military that 
actually has done nothing to do but make you less safe for the past 90 
odd years (through no fault of the average soldier), and the other half 
of your money goes to subsidizes for corporations that profit off of 
you. Not to mention all the civil liberty violations the government had 
to go through to get your data first.
Why do you think a lot of governments have been trying or have banned tiktok on government phones?
Yes, let me fetch the internal emails and communities from president Xi for you.
One quick sample, have you tried to search for the forbidden words and provide results in all apps in china?
To think any apps /company can push anything that’s not aligned with Chinese government is silly.
Have you see what happened to Jack Ma? Li wen liang?
Tell me with a straight face that’s not government interference and how the company didn’t bend over.
[Haunting_Berry7971]: If there was any real evidence the Chinese government was 
directing TikTok to promote certain content TikTok would already be 
banned. Stop buying into new Cold War propaganda.

They have a relationship with the Chinese government because 
they’re a company that exists in China, the same way most major American
 companies have some sort of relationship with the American government. I

[pungentpickles]: GenZ might be the generation most susceptible to propaganda in 
history lmao. I’ve given up on right and wrong. We live in a post-truth 
reality. Anyone who thinks they’re above that are just as propagandized 
as those they feel superior to.
It’s unfortunate really, I think a lot of generations probably 
understand that propaganda is sowed into things. Some of which could be 
completely skewed or false. With this in mind the most common defense 
seems to be relying on their own moral compass.
Here’s the problem with that, it breeds outrage and strong 
emotional responses from people. Good luck talking someone out of a 
stance when they believe it is the moral high ground and have been force
 fed shit information on a daily basis.
It’s all extremely divisive and there seems to be no way to slow 
this down. I mean really how do we get off this ride at this point? This
 is far more than a TikTok thing too. It is everywhere.

[[deleted]]: gen z likes to call themselves as "not susceptible to propaganda"
We all tell ourselves lies to make ourselves feel better.
Zoomers are largely too young and don’t have enough real world 
experience to know what tf they are talking about re:any of the major 
global issues they really care about.  Climate change and energy is a 
great example - I build clean energy networks in developing countries 
and it’s incredibly painful how ignorant so many of the mainstream 
conversations are of the realities of grid mananagement, energy 
generation and supply chains when pushing platforms like “ban oil” and 
“end fossil fuels”.
Like, I don’t think many zoomers eating that propaganda (and yes, 
Carbon as the evil causing global warming is propaganda by the people 
wanting to profit off of carbon markets) realize that actually 
implementing what they say they want would effectively put most of 
Africa, south/southeast Asia and Latin America back into the Stone Age.
It’s not that the generation is dumb.  We millennials were 
similarly naive and idealistic about our favorite causes at the same 
age.  And definitely leaned far intor/confidentlyincorrectjust like Zoomers are
[rh397]: It doesn't make sense to me to consider Trump as anti-capitalist. He's not. One might even say he's too capitalist.
The OP didn't say that, china just benefits from a trump

gives china more room on the world stage. They can be pro trump and

No. The government is protecting the ruling-class’s interests. There’s a difference and imho it’s very important.
I don’t think Chinese world hegemony is within anyone’s interest if your interest is democracy.
Moreover I don’t think Chinese control of semiconductors is within your interest, either.
“China” is not seeking world hegemony, nor is the Chinese government.
I agree that more diversity in the supply chain of semi-conductors
 is a good thing, but that’s clearly not the U.S. governments goal. It 
is to expand its military power while attempting to limit the military 
potential of the Chinese government. Otherwise they wouldn’t have banned

[Key_Woodpecker4008]: save europe kids took over tiktok but I must admit the sounds they use are bangers
[Serious_Solid_461]: TikTok is known for censorship. They very, very rarely censor any 
sort of liberal propaganda, but constantly censor any content that 
questions, their extreme liberal narrative…. They are known for 
consistently and indiscriminately shadow banning issues such as 
pro-life, anti-communism, Christian posts, etc. however, at the same 
time, they are extremely lax on leftist and Commies- you’re pretty much 
the same exact thing these days anyways.
[angrey3737]: it also depends on what you’re interested in. it makes sense that 
you’re gonna get those types of videos after not being on it for awhile.
 when i first got tiktok, it was charlie demelio and that orange dude

Hey everyone,
I feel like a lot of us grew up with social media as our main way 
to stay informed. It’s where we get our news, trends, opinions, and 
everything. But honestly, my attention has been wrecked by it. TikTok, 
X, Instagram... I go in to check one thing and suddenly I’ve lost 90 
minutes.
So I started wondering what if we could actually control what we 
see? Like, fully. What if we could own our feed instead of 
letting the algorithm choose what we scroll through?
To play with that idea, I built a small app. You just type in what
 you want to follow, like “recent crypto big things”. The app uses AI to
 pull updates every few hours. It only fetches what you tell it to.
Currently this app is more useful if you want to be focused on 
something (might not be that helpful for entertainment yet). So at least
 when you want to focus this app can be an option.
I posted here a while back during beta and got a ton of useful feedback (thank you!!). Now we are on the App Store (try it here).
 It’s still super early and rough around the edges, but if you're 
interested pls let me know! Would really love to know what people think.

[NoChipmunk9467]: I mean isn’t that what the very first thing Instagram & twitter ask you when you create an account ??
yeah, they do ask that. but mostly so they can start pushing stuff you didn’t really ask for.
what I’m trying to build is different. it only shows you what 
you tell it to. You’re in control from the start. you just describe
 what you want to follow, instead of picking vague categories that don’t
 really help. and eventually, you’ll be able to go back and change your 
prompt whenever you want. kind of like editing your own algorithm.
It’s definitely more useful if you have something specific you 
want to keep up with and don’t want distractions. but if just looking to
 kill time, Instagram and Twitter still win at that.
I understand what you mean will if your good at coding and other stuff like that go ahead and build it

[CactusJuiceMyCabbage]: How will we know if the AI has a politically motivated bias though
to be honest, we don’t have that kind of control built in yet. but
 in the ideal version, the user would be in charge. like, you could tell
 the app you only want news from more neutral sources, and the ai would 
try to understand that and check for bias.
instead of us deciding things in the background, we want users to 
guide that themselves and find their own balance. that’s the bigger 
vision. obviously, it’s not simple. there’s a lot of nuance. but i 
really believe there’s a path to get there.
Like what if youre left leaning and keep getting mad at whatever Fox News the AI fetches for you lol
haha yeah, I can imagine I’m gonna go mad lol. ideally, you could 
just tell the AI that you don’t want to read right-leaning sources. that
 might become possible after a few rounds of iteration.
In the longer-term roadmap, we might use some level of 
recommendation algorithms to slightly adjust what the AI fetches for you
 and still based on your original prompt. That way, it could figure out 
that you're left-leaning without you explicitly saying it.but we’d make 
that visible, not a black box to users, if we ever decide to adopt any 
recommendation algorithm stuff.
Yeah, I guess the only issue is that theres a chance that the left
 learning sources have misinformation or conflict with other left 
leaning media, but thats an already prevalent issue even without AI.
Congrats on actually taking initiative on this app though, as a 
hobbyist mobile dev myself this is really cool and I wish you the best!
I took notes! those are helpful feedback! hope we can build out things fast and share more updates with you
[Shot_Fudge_6195]: to be honest, we don’t have that kind of control built in yet. but
 in the ideal version, the user would be in charge. like, you could tell
 the app you only want news from more neutral sources, and the ai would 
try to understand that and check for bias.
instead of us deciding things in the background, we want users to 
guide that themselves and find their own balance. that’s the bigger 
vision. obviously, it’s not simple. there’s a lot of nuance. but i 
really believe there’s a path to get there.
Like what if youre left leaning and keep getting mad at whatever Fox News the AI fetches for you lol
haha yeah, I can imagine I’m gonna go mad lol. ideally, you could 
just tell the AI that you don’t want to read right-leaning sources. that
 might become possible after a few rounds of iteration.
In the longer-term roadmap, we might use some level of 
recommendation algorithms to slightly adjust what the AI fetches for you
 and still based on your original prompt. That way, it could figure out 
that you're left-leaning without you explicitly saying it.but we’d make 
that visible, not a black box to users, if we ever decide to adopt any 
recommendation algorithm stuff.

What about something like Ace Studio's vocal algorithm, which is 
technically NN ("AI") but that uses the voices of singers they hired? 
They give the singers a portion of the revenue from your purchase as 
well.
The software also runs on your computer, meaning it uses no more 
electricity than your computer can draw (if not much less), meaning the 
environmental concern is not really an issue like it is for the large 
server farms. And your computer mostly likely doesn't use evaporative 
water cooling.
Should music or spoken word content made this way be censored?

[Alarming_Result_1413]: Vocaloid has been around for decades, not sure why it would be a problem now
The newest version of vocaloid uses an algorithm that is technically a neural network.
It does all the processing in your own PC. If your PC is a huge power draw, that's on you.
A vocaloid producer
That feature is just a voice changer...

[MarzipanFederal8059]: Js, I think the reason they were accepted was because we knew it 
was fake so it added to the style in some way. This ai cover stuff, it 
feels deceptive to alot of people. so, morally, i cant endorse tht at

I am chronically offline besides reddit for the memes and weird 
stuff. But I recently saw somewhere that a lot of younger men are MAGA. 
I’m just curious what part of the internet they are on that radicalized 
them? So confused.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Genseric1234]: Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram.
Definitely a difference in general opinion between Reddit and the other platforms.
Even across subs…libertarians and AnCap don’t typically agree on a
 lot, then the conservative sub is obviously still filled with 
evangelicals and baptists, and the broader conservative ideology is 
scattered into the winds
Even the neocons didn’t last all that long once the proud boys were found to be a fed setup
It’s literally coming down to religious fanatics vs. 
constitutionalists vs. socialists vs. straight communists willing to 
vacate
Two extremes and neither good
Well there's one of those 4 that's clearly better than all of the others (hint it's constitutionalists)

YouTube. YouTube is where all the alt right pipeline content is.
Is the alt right pipeline in the room with us? My YouTube 
recommended is car videos and shit posts about bad movies. What are you 
watching to make the algorithm do that?
That's kinda of the point. Youtube is where the algorithm forms a 
pipeline for those that continue to feed the algorithm. If you don't 
watch alt-right political videos, they wont show up on your feed.
Idk if this is still the case but it used to be that if you 
watched even a bit of one right-leaning political video then you'd 
suddenly get recommended loads of them for weeks. There's also the 
lesser problem that if you watch fandom content, the algorithm doesn't 
distinguish the politics of those very well, which is why it took like a
 year for me to get anti-woke Doctor Who videos out of my recs
I was fully in it when I was younger. All of the alt rights 
largest voices are on there, and even if they don't have channels 
anymore their content is passed around like crazy in other videos and 
shorts. I personally don't see their stuff anymore either because I 
worked very hard at making sure to dislike and click not interested on 
every video that popped up. But Shapiro, Peterson, Prager, Crowder, 
Rubin...ect are all there and people love the shit they say.
Nah, it’s real. I’ve seen it with my brother, my dad, my friend’s 
dad, and while neither my friend nor I are remotely alt right, the 
algorithm occasionally tries to nudge alt right videos our way.
Watch one Ben Shapiro video and your feed will be filled with similar stuff lol
I will get normal news headline videos. From just mainstream new 
sources. The comments are almost always a MAGA circle jerk to the likes 
ofr/Conservative.
I didn’t know watching Epic Rap Battles of History was slowly radicalizing me into a fascist without my knowing.
And this whole time I thought I was a socialist. What a twist.
Lol what? All of the alt right grifters are on YouTube. Ben 
Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Prager, Crowder, Rubin...ect. Even if they 
don't have channels any longer their content is passed around like 
crazy. Just because you're not seeing it in your highly personalized 
algorithm doesn't mean it's not there.
Youtube was an alt-right pipeline 10 years ago. Now a lot of those
 channels have been banned. And I can tell y’all where I get my 
information from but I’m not a Trump Cult MAGA cuck
They're still there. Even if their channels were banned, which 
many haven't been, their content is still passed around like crazy in 
others videos and shorts.
But with who 10 years ago?
When I think of YouTube I think of TYT. They’ve been in the game since the beginning of YouTube
Ever heard of Gavin McInnes, Milo Yiannopoulos, etc? It’s frankly a
 miracle that some people who were part of that crowd circa 2015didn’tget banned in the late 2010s or early 2020s.
No idea about Gavin but damn you threw me back with that Milo. He was an absolute riot.

[Ok_Requirement4788]: Funnily enough what "radicalized" them is actually the left wing 
media. Specifically the "woke" movement and their pure insanity.
But like, that’s culture stuff. Why be political about something 
that only affects, like, 3% of the population? Like, why vote for 
someone whose only goal is to make life worse for a minority and also 
not make it better for the majority.
Because that 3% of the population are trying to affect the entire population.
why vote for someone whose only goal is to make life worse for a minority and also not make it better for the majority.
People don't want the cultural change as it does affect the majority so combating is within their interests.
Also people believe he does make it better for the majority by doubling down on crime and on the border security.
I'm not a Trump supporter but he still does stuff that are within the interests of the population.
Just like, the president can’t make laws to stop people from 
posting online about their pronouns and I doubt most of these MAGA bros 
actually interact with woke folk. So it just seems like a silly reason 
to join a movement.
Maybe for you it isn't a big reason but for others it is.
Everyone has their own priorities on what's important.
If you voted for Trump, you voted for the largest peacetime middle
 class tax hike in history.  Those aren’t your interests.
As I said some people have their own priorities, that doesn't mean
 there aren't negatives it's just which priority weights more than the 
other.
And I wasn't following the news these last days.

[TheLesbianTheologian]: TikTok radicalized my brother, actually. He used to be somewhat 
conservative, but mostly “live & let live” when it came to the

Now he’s a homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, jobless asshole who thinks he deserves an Aryan tradwife.

[[deleted]]: it was actually left progressive media that "radicalized" me but 
what was left progressive  10 years ago is "far right" now
Used to watch: mostly TYT back in the day
Continued to watch some of the skeptic channels that used to 
debate creationists like shoe0head (who is still left wing - just not 
the mainstream dem kind) , sargon/carl benjamin, styx666 - all folks who
 also opposed what at the time was fringe cring "sjw"s before they 
became mainstream dem base.
used to watch a lot but tuned out mostly still watch sometimes: infowars
mostly watch now: Dave Ramsey thats like my number 1
Wow. That’s wild. Do MAGA people run into to SJWs all the time? 
Like how many illegal immigrants and trans people do MAGA interact with 
in real life? Like, it makes them go out and buy a hat and worship a 
dude who thinks windmills give people cancer.
I just feel I’ve run into more MAGA bros than woke people in my day to day. And I live in a blue state.
What political positions of a left wing progressive would make you “far right” today?
Anti monopolism
big tech and media need to have antitrust action break them up
progressives used to beleive in free speech too
anti-big pharma used to be a hugely left wing thing
not that I am anti vax - i am pro vax CHOICE - but the antivaxxers
 used to be a bunch of hippies that beleived in healing crystals
Never cared if you were gay but the actuvist crowd has taken the gender wars ideology too far

years and lost my nerves but gained an idea of what internet and people 
are like...)
(Also when I was kinda not into politics YouTube kept recommending it to me just because I followed Warhammer :) )
Half of Instagram being "stupid ugly trans and wokes"... - This I

kinda shaped his views a little and definitely became "his area of

[No-Consideration2413]: We’re not radicalized lmfao, if anything you guys are the ones 
calling for radical things like “medically transitioning” children.
Just because you call it “progress” doesn’t mean it is.
I’ve actually gotten stronger in my views by talking to you guys here on Reddit, though.
This is the opinion of most people. It wasn’t long ago certain 
social media platforms would want to have banned you for opinions like 
these.
I’m still banned in a few subs for disagreeing with the left’s 
consensus or for matching the level of spite I’m given for disagreeing 
with
But like, are trans issues the only ones that MAGA care about? I 
don’t really see how they could possibly be running into trans issues 
throughout their day to day. I’m just assuming the content they watch is
 just full of trans stuff. Where are all these people actually trying to
 transition kids? Is this like, that, “they are eating cats and dogs” 
kind of thing? Or like, windmills give you cancer?
This isn’t even a trans issue, this is an attack on kids.
If someone wants to transition at 18 it’s one thing, but puberty 
blockers are being used on children as young as 8-9 and HRT is being 
given to minors as well.
If you stand with the side that’s supporting a crime against 
humanity like that, even considering no other issue, you’re the bad guy.

[TheKindnesses]: insta, tiktok, yt. right wing content is way more consumable 
because its content that capitalizes on a lack of nuance and 
dramatization. it often focuses on fringe groups like trans people, and 
framing things outside of how they normally are, with scenarios that are
 rare but highly emotional or controversial. this emotional aspect of 
the content, and further engagement w the comments helps to propogate 
that content in the algorithms.
basically social media algorithms are the crux
[Any-Piccolo-1753]: I get my news exclusively through racist podcasts and that’s how I form my worldview
[ChargerRob]: Cambridge Analytica allowed the micro-targeting of propaganda to the masses.
Facebook was first, YouTube next, and it spread from there.
Billionaires started buying influencers to push their points. Then
 they built a network of fake media sites to regurgitate the nonsense 
their network of right wing think tanks made up.
Now private investment has taken over your mainstream media, the 
NBCs, CBS, CNNs, etc. Buying brands and converting to propaganda.
This makes the most sense. Since, I’ve never actually run into any
 of the issues the MAGA crowd complain about and I live in a city. I’ve 
actually tried being like “okay, I’m going to pay attention. Where are 
these evil immigrant trans folk.” Couldn’t find any.
Because when you take an issue, any issue, and blow up the 0.003% 
that is reality into a mainstream issue, people will fall for it. Add 
colorful emotional language and soon they fear it. Its just marketing 
101.

change based on your opinion.
Rednote is known as Xiaohongshu in China and is extremely popular 
among young people, especially Chinese international students. This 
might be the first time Chinese and American users are interacting on 
the same platform, and it’s bound to be very interesting!
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[festival-papi]: You could call it a digital protest. People know that the U.S. 
government spies on the public, it's an open secret. People know that 
the biggest social media platforms which arebasedin the U.S. 
are allowed to push algorithms to create narratives while they collect 
data on the users. We have Elon Musk, a foreigner, curating a specific 
algorithm and agenda and that's supposed to be fine because he's based 
here and through that has to align with the interests of the U.S.
At least my CCP spy was feeding me some awesome content
[evilkitten03]: This might be the first time Chinese and American users are

Isn't TikTok own by a Chinese company anyway? I don't see how it 
be any different from using TikTok unless REDNote has some quirk that I 
don't know about. (which to be fair, I hadn't used TikTok for awhile to 
know anything much about REDNote beaide people are moving to there)
It's a little different in that sense, at least as far as I can 
tell. Red Note already has an organic Chinese following. TikTok on the 
other hand was by a Chinese company but a variation (intended for a more
 global/western audience) on their domestic app Douyin which meant that 
while there were some Chinese people the two groups were largely 
separated from each other.
red note is way more chinese than tiktok
Tik Tok is the international version of chinas Douyin. You can’t 
use Tik Tok in China because the CCP doesn’t want its people interacting
 with the rest of the world.
That's far from being the reason. Red note is literally owned by a
 public, AKA, CCP owned company and the app is published in the US, 
hence, willingly allowing interaction between Chinese and foreigners.
TikTok, or rather byte dance, a private company, simply chose to 
cater to different audiences and needs with different apps.
Then why is Tik Tok firewalled in China?
There are almost no Chinese on tiktok.
There are over 200 million Chinese on Rednote.

[constantmusic]: I see this as a ‘digital protest’ resulting from the impending US 
ban of TikTok. The government is always far behind the will of the 
people. I remember when they banned Juul vape only to have a dozen new 
companies pop up to fill the gap.
[[deleted]]: Because they enjoy the content and Americans generally don't enjoy
 being told what to do. You can't control people so easily, the TikTok 
ban was symbolic at best and most likely was an attempt for US buyers to
 wrestle control of the app out of China.
[Eyerisch]: I love that we're able to interact with Chinese youth like this, 
maybe it'll build better relations with the country when our generation 
inherits leadership. However, given that it's a Chinese app, how much 
free speech is *really* allowed? Conversing is cool and all, but it's 
pretty defeating knowing that you can't freely criticize one of most 
authoritarian governments in current existence
[hxdgkd]: To say anything pleasant to Chinese users is the key to winning 
Chinese followers, such as 'I'm going to Rednote because I think it's my
 duty.', 'I love Tiananmen Square because there is an annual festival 
every year, 'Wuhan bats are delicious', etc.
Say any from the above to see a magical growth in followers.

ever organize like this otherwise

i was just gonna go back to insta reels fuggit :P
[Eyerisch]: i was just gonna go back to insta reels fuggit :P
[PitifulAd236]: Most americans (and people in general) couldn't care less about 
their data being stolen and just want their daily fill of easily 
consumable content.
[Shiroyasha2397]: Another distraction for people lol
[Working-Celery4000]: Lol people are so amazingly dumb. I get that it's a "digital 
protest" but you don't NEED to use a Chinese social media app lmao.
Get a hobby. Jesus Christ.
Not to mention, China isn't exactly the most agreeable country 
with their extreme censorship of the internet, among other things.
[Desxon]: Because TikTok as a psyop worked and now anything anti-American is good, even if it's totalitarian police state
[Smiles4YouRawrX3]: I got permabanned there for posting an image of Xi Jinping as Winnie the Pooh and saying "Free Taiwan" LOL
Imagine that. I've gotten banned from subs for much less and you 
think Chinese people is going to be happy about a foreigner giving them 
his opinion about their matters... Taiwan is being used by the US the 
same way as Ukraine was used with the infamous "Fuck the EU".
Well deserved ban.
Okay CCP agent, Tiananmen Square is real btw
According to your logic, Americans don't like to hear voices 
supporting China. Can you please get out of American social media?

To be fair, their Qouran tells people to do that. It says "Spark

how you like, but what it means is, go out of your way to make people's

wives.

A lot of these kinds of verses are not timeless or meant to be

Muslim faith are rewarded in the afterlife
Literally the Bible says to sell your daughters, have slaves and 
be cruel to them, and more. It says plainly that women are beneath men.
It has been used to justify the exact same things the Quaran has been used to justify.
Verses or it means nothing
I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
And everything on which she lies during her menstrual impurity 
shall be unclean. Everything also on which she sits shall be unclean.
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.
Just to name a few.
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism aslo  known Abrahamic 
religions have all treated women and LGBT people like crap. And this is 
the case of many religions

[umlautlyh]: ive had it explained to me that the extremist muslim groups only 
represent a small fraction of the total population of muslims, 100% of 
all muslims i have met have been cool as fuck except for that kid in 
10th grade who joked about bombing the school.
Even that fraction is majorly overblown because not everybody has 
the same access to the same information from the same source. Yeah, the 
bombing a school joke is really pushing it too far, but when you've been
 through some shit in your life, crappy and distasteful humour is a 
coping mechanism, but even that doesn't go too well at times. But, yes, I
 can vouch for maybe 35% of Muslim people that we're cool to be around. 
Hell, we'll join you for a beer but within limits.
i thought muslims didnt drink alcohol at all? NA beers maybe?
Some of us indulge, because we're only ever gonna get the chance 
to do so once and it's only when we're travelling international. As an 
example, whenever my father and I travel together for vacations or work,
 it's usually international travel, so we get single can or pint and go 
back and forth on it, so neither one of us is inebriated, but we have 
memories of the experience. Non-alcoholic beers are pretty common in 
Muslim countries, generally in the form of flavored and carbonated malt 
beverages, which are pretty damn good. So, really, depends on if you're 
adventurous enough, if you wanna try it once, or you're just in it to 
satiate your interest.

But I don't respect Muslim countries due to people using Islam to

Wait, that's a thing? Guinness 0.0?
Yea it's a new alcohol free Guinness idk how it tastes tho
ooh, i'll check it out next time i travel

[IsatMilFinnie]: Because in general society went “maybe being dicks to people is bad”
[No_Discount_6028]: Anti-essentialism is a good thing. Black people have a higher 
average crime rate (due to a variety of sociological factors), but you 
shouldn't treat them like criminals. Muslims are disproportionately more
 conservative than the general populace, but you shouldn't treat them 
like Conservatives. Men are more likely to commit rape than the general 
populace, but you shouldn't treat them like rapists.
Just be nice to people until they give you a reason not to.
Sure, we should be moderately nice to everyone. But it doesnt mean
 we want to live next to them, we all know whats happening to our 
cities.
You have a right to live wherever you want, but you're much better
 off going on violent crime rates than demographics, which is publicly 
available information. Most people here in the developed world won't 
care about you one way or the other as long as you leave them alone.
Personally, I'm more interested in trying to actually solve the 
systemic problems which cause violent crime to begin with. There's a 
very clear causation between generational poverty and violence, and 
likewise between a lack of comprehensive sex ed and sexual violence.

[Turbulent-Fig-3123]: They're just people mate, why would I treat people bad based off 
just their religion? I'm an atheist but perfectly fine with Christians 
and Jewish people, why would I treat Muslims any different?
I actually like people with different experiences and cultures.
[Nate2322]: Because why wouldn’t they be? The vast majority are good and 
normal people they only get a bad name for a few radicals but most 
religions have radicals that give the religion a bad name so it’s not 
really an issue.
The radicals don't help given that it takes the kind of stuff that
 happens in Western nations up to 11. Things like the whole girls not in
 education thing or justifying raping girls for not wearing the right 
stuff.
Although think it'd definitely be unfair to view a whole religious
 group off of their leaders and people who act in bad faith, despite 
where their religious texts might disagree, since I'd give christains 
the same benefit of the doubt.
Despite America as a christian nation having old men in the 
government who want to control women's bodies, they don't represent the 
views of the majority of people. Some people cherry pick to justify 
being a bigot, but plenty of people also just ignore those parts and 
never act upon it.

Exactly like what the fuck mods?
[goldenbrushes]: Exactly like what the fuck mods?
[[deleted]]: Because we should respect ppls religions ?
[PlayaFourFiveSix]: Well...because we believe we shouldn't discriminate based on 
religion? I'm not a fan of organized religion at all and know the harms 
that organized religion (especially Abrahamic organized religion) 
causes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be against those that follow one
 particular religion vs another. People are people at the end of the 
day.
[Areyouserious68]: Why would I treat anyone different for their beliefs. That's 
litdrally how 90% of all world problems started. I ain't doing that

Unless It's Islam.

 world that act out tend to follow a sect of the same religion.

[Crooked_Cock]: Because treating someone like garbage because of their religion is a shitty thing to do?
[Choice-Grapefruit-44]: That is your prejudice. Not a generation problem.
[goldenbrushes]: Omg why the duck are people normalizing racism and xenophobia?? 
Why are people normalizing hate towards Muslims?? I will never 
understand why religion is taking such a big part of todays politics.
[Gsomethepatient]: I'm non confrontational
[ItchyContribution758]: As a queer atheist, I say that one's religion is not a 
determinator of what kind of people they are. Sure, it's possible for 
religious fundamentalism to make you an asshole, but muslims on a whole 
don't deserve flack just because they're muslim.
[ncmn-ngnr]: Just because a few certain areas of Islam are behaving badly 
towards us, doesn’t give us the right to devolve into hatred. Muslims 
have committed a number of crimes across the globe, but that doesn’t 
mean that the Muslim family in the house down the block deserves the 
hatred
You know all of the bad things that America has done to its own 
economy and how Gen Z is forced to accept the consequences of these 
actions despite not having caused them ourselves? Gee, I wonder what the
 connection is
And about hatred: what does it actually accomplish? Beyond the 
momentary practice of developing a rational degree of wariness it only 
leads to more trouble. Hate makes war, which leads to death and 
suffering, which in turn breeds more hate. Hasn’t it gone on for long 
enough? Isn’t it a time humans use our biological advantage of a complex
 mind and figured out a better way to interact?
[SeanGrow_]: Reverse here in Europe
The more interaction you have with Muslims, the more you hate em. 
They ruin their countries with oppressive archaic religious laws and 
then flee to our countries and refuse to convert to our religion and 
refuse to participate in our culture.
Nothing wrong with Arabs, but Islam is a wicked religion coming from a Christian
[Ill-Character7952]: Because they haven't been to Muslim majority countries.
Go take a look on how they treat their women.
Even this take is horribly bad and shows the same old ignorant 
"Arab=Muslim" stereotype. I mean even the Arab world has major 
differences like a lot more women attending universities in Algeria and 
Egypt than Morocco.
Its like assuming all Americans are gun toting Trump supporting 
redneck white supremacists and ignoring the differences between states. 
Even in a rightwing state like Alabama there are major differences 
between regions. Mongtomery is a lot more progressive and at lest not as
 openly racist compared to say Guntersville.
So bad take on your end.

So no, wearing a hijab isn’t going to give you side eyes.

[Expensive-Virus-5683]: they are dumb, when they will bear the brunt, then they will change
[One_Weather_9417]: Their skewed education and programmed mindsets told them to.
[Specific_Syrup_6927]: Most GenZ are younger and care more about being friendly and left 
leaning than reality would dictate. They only see and interact with 
muslims in their schools or neighborhoods. Muslims that are generally 
more secular and westernized. They then think thisbis the case with ALL 
muslims.
Once they take some history courses, look at geo politics, and see
 areas that are predominently muslim. They will change their views.
[Heyyoguy123]: I’m assuming you’re asking us Americans. It’s because there’s 
significantly less of them living in the US and they’re almost never 
migrants (unlike the UK and mainland Europe), they’re educated and 
highly skilled workers and their families who happened to be Muslim. 
They’re never radicalised.
I say this as an American living in the UK (London)
Vast majority of Muslims in the UK are born here
And there still are much more migrant workers and refugees and 
they’re nearly all Muslim. Those types of people don’t have the best 
reputation. So the two categories get associated with each other.
In America: Muslim = skilled, educated person
In UK, Muslim = refugees or children of refugees. Usually not educated and skilled workers

shopping center or Reading, to constantly watch your pockets for Muslim 
pick pocketers.
[coldcoldman2]: I understand the logical paths of religious people (as a formerly 
religious person myself) and how some beliefs on things like morals and 
history I vehemently disagree with come about from being tied to the 
words of an all powerful objectively-perfect being.
Like I dont think that Being is real but i understand why one 
would think homosexuality is a sin even if they cant fully describe 
problems with it on a physical and societal basis. Its because God/Allah
 said so, and they literally can not be wrong in the eyes of a believer.
I still deeply value the relationships with the many christians 
and (not as many) muslims in my life even if i fundamentally disagree 
with them on many things, because i like having friends and they treat 
me well.
[LloydAsher0]: I've only met the moderate ones. I'm actively avoiding the ones 
that take the book seriously. Same for Catholics but then again the 
worst thing the Catholics have done to me is say I'm going to hell. Join
 the club.
[atleastimtryingnow]: because they’re marginalized, or used to be. Now, there’s no 
reason to be even slightly h sympathetic to them. Ruined my and many 
other lives
[[deleted]]: what's wrong with Muslims?
They're just people who have a different religion.
They're not Terrorist.
All the Muslims I've talked to are amazing people.

TÍTULO: Why do younger gen z censor themselves so much? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Grape, corn, unalived, and many others I can't remember. I think 
serious topics should be spoken about seriously and by using goofy 
language for serious topics you take all of the reality out of the 
situation. A lot of things are fucking horrible and deplorable and 
should be treated as such, not censored or cute-ified. ALSO there's 
already alternative language you can use instead. Like instead of rape 
or sexual assault you can say "they forced themselves upon them" or 
something similar. I dont get it and its becoming such a widely used 
thing among non gen zers as well. I dont wanna ever hear a grown ass man
 say "he deadass unalived her" ever again. It comes off extremely 
childish and apathetic.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[065Walker]: Because social media and algorithms filter you out/ hide you for 
using NSFW / PG terminology. This is circumvention tactics, not 
immaturity. Your solutions are wordy.
Eh that argument doesn't work when they say it irl with their 
human lips and mouths also the internet shouldn't be babified either and
 by bending over before they ever even ask is just BEGGING for more 
censorship. If you can say fuck you can say death when talking about 
death. Death isn't fun or cute. Death is death.

Nobody is forcing you to be censored in real life. Adults should 
talk like adults and teenagers shouldn’t be talking like nine-year-olds.
It's used ironically, I don't think anybody thinks they can't just say the word. Shit isn't that serious.
Look at china the term for anti gov  is now river crab due to online censorship
Yeah but in most countries you won't be fired for saying the word 
"killed" or something. Its important to not pre censor yourself when you
 can because it makes it easy for the authorities to go "Oh well you're 
doing it anyway may as well formalize it."
Edit: Might adopt that river crab thing though because its good for symbolism if nothing else.
It's not Gen Z slang, it's legit corporate slang/censored words. 
It's just that when you text and type a word a lot, you begin to also 
use it in real life. Soon enough, these words that were originally just 
key words are now actual words... It sucks I wish Zoomer slang/Gen Alpha
 slang was a lot more applicable like millennial and Zillennial (and 
that's saying a lot for the shit I grew up with) but I can't stand using
 these "ahhh" words when I am just gonna curse like a grown ASS adult.
I literally just had one of my comments silently censored for 
calling dating apps a Ψop. See how I had to bypass the censorship there?
That’s another problem.  You censored yourself and I have 
legitimately no idea what you’re trying to say.  Yop?  Cop?  Slop?  
Trident-op?  Candle-op?  I can’t think of any offensive words that ends 
in -op.  I’m sure I’d understand what you meant if you didn’t censor 
yourself, but now I’m sitting here scratching my head.  So sometimes 
censoring words causes clarity to be lost.
ψ is a Greek letter known as psi, so the person is likely saying 
psyop. I have no clue why they self-censored that of all things, but I 
guess that's the world we live in now.
Yeah that. I had a comment with proof get filtered, and I'm pretty sure it's because I used the full word.
Hey buddy when you start to talk a certain way online it comes out in normal conversation lmfao. Common sense
Don't you use words you found on tv? Media shapes vocabulary.
Edit: also pretty sure new words are instated via usage in media. Ex: google
Well it's pretty common for terminology and speech patterns in an 
frequented environment to become habitual outside of that environment.
Social media censorship often follows advertisers, I'd argue 
against this encouraging censorship, as services already have difficulty
 with this and are reactionary.
Regardless of how you feel these words should be taken, the 
environment we frequent i.e. the internet, social media, etc. These 
terms can get you tagged, suppressed, banned, demonetized or whatever 
else.
As a millennial, I grew up with so much use of the word “kill” and
 “death” in children’s media. Even SpongeBob used those words. So yeah, I
 feel you.
The algorithms are definitely to blame for censorship of language,
 but it’s really cringe when people use what’s essentially newspeak in 
an actual conversation.
I had to tell a friend off MY AGE who used the word “unalive” with me once. Thankfully, he’s never said it since.
Social media is pretty much shaping us into an Orwellian society. 
What’s even more concerning is that TikTok is the main app that’s behind
 these policies, and they’re controlled by China, which is a communist 
dictatorship with concentration camps and next-to-no privacy.
As an autistic and very emotionally sensitive individual, I’m more
 triggered by this change in language than I am by “death”, “kill”, 
“suicide”, etc. It’s because my mind immediately thinks about all the 
dystopian crap behind this.
Social media and algorithms don't actually do that. I use NSFW 
words in my TikToks all the time and still get millions of views.
Maybe, but Elon has already stated X / Twitter’s policy is freedom
 of speech not freedom of reach and posts may be”deboosted or 
demonetized” in addition to being heavily automated in their filtering. 
Meta has been known to suppress posts based on their wording / 
terminology, it’s also coordinated with governments on this. YouTube’s 
“ad-pocalypse” was centered around the effort to clean up the content 
placed with ads and in practice demonetized creators based on their 
content.
I can’t speak to TikTok’s algorithm or where they draw their 
lines, but I’m almost willing to bet they exist. From what I can tell 
TikTok’s algorithm creates light echo chambers which could be why you 
feel less impacted.
That and you get banned from many places if you use big boy terms. Try and say the dreaded R word.
That one is a slur so I’m not surprised. We’re not talking about slurs here.
The fact you think it's a slur is very sad. I once had a moderator
 tell me I can't use that word, I have to use language I'd be ok with 
kids hearing, so stuff like swears are acceptable.
Bud, it's the swears I don't use around kids. and the "slurs" I do. This site is so backwards it's nuts.
I’m autistic. I am part of the group of people that is targeted 
when you use the word r*tarded. It is a slur. It is something people say
 to me to tell me that I don’t know what I’m talking about. It is used 
to dismiss me so that people who don’t want to listen to me about my 
needs when I’m trying to communicate them don’t have to. It’s also used 
by bullies in order to communicate to other bullies who their target 
should be. There is no excuse to be using it against anyone. Go ahead 
and call people stupid if you have to, if they genuinely are being 
stupid, but you can’t be making fun of disabled people like that.
I'm going to introduce you to the concept of the Euphemism 
Treadmill, and it is the reason why attempting to make words into no-no 
words is destined for failure. Because what you call a slur today, will 
be replaced tomorrow by whatever softer term you deem safe as an 
alternative.
I'm not going to argue this, you're going to imply that the word 
is only ever used as a derogatory term and somehow holds power over you.
 I advise you to remember that words cannot hurt you, they are not 
sticks and stones. Bullies will find new words, new words will have the 
same old meaning, this will continue forever. Toughen up a bit mate, 
it'll do you good.

Edit: also pretty sure new words are instated via usage in media. Ex: google
Well it's pretty common for terminology and speech patterns in an 
frequented environment to become habitual outside of that environment.
Social media censorship often follows advertisers, I'd argue 
against this encouraging censorship, as services already have difficulty
 with this and are reactionary.
Regardless of how you feel these words should be taken, the 
environment we frequent i.e. the internet, social media, etc. These 
terms can get you tagged, suppressed, banned, demonetized or whatever 
else.
As a millennial, I grew up with so much use of the word “kill” and
 “death” in children’s media. Even SpongeBob used those words. So yeah, I
 feel you.
The algorithms are definitely to blame for censorship of language,
 but it’s really cringe when people use what’s essentially newspeak in 
an actual conversation.
I had to tell a friend off MY AGE who used the word “unalive” with me once. Thankfully, he’s never said it since.
Social media is pretty much shaping us into an Orwellian society. 
What’s even more concerning is that TikTok is the main app that’s behind
 these policies, and they’re controlled by China, which is a communist 
dictatorship with concentration camps and next-to-no privacy.
As an autistic and very emotionally sensitive individual, I’m more
 triggered by this change in language than I am by “death”, “kill”, 
“suicide”, etc. It’s because my mind immediately thinks about all the 
dystopian crap behind this.

Nobody is forcing you to be censored in real life. Adults should 
talk like adults and teenagers shouldn’t be talking like nine-year-olds.
It's used ironically, I don't think anybody thinks they can't just say the word. Shit isn't that serious.
Look at china the term for anti gov  is now river crab due to online censorship
Yeah but in most countries you won't be fired for saying the word 
"killed" or something. Its important to not pre censor yourself when you
 can because it makes it easy for the authorities to go "Oh well you're 
doing it anyway may as well formalize it."
Edit: Might adopt that river crab thing though because its good for symbolism if nothing else.

[YoloSwaggins1147]: It's not Gen Z slang, it's legit corporate slang/censored words. 
It's just that when you text and type a word a lot, you begin to also 
use it in real life. Soon enough, these words that were originally just 
key words are now actual words... It sucks I wish Zoomer slang/Gen Alpha
 slang was a lot more applicable like millennial and Zillennial (and 
that's saying a lot for the shit I grew up with) but I can't stand using
 these "ahhh" words when I am just gonna curse like a grown ASS adult.
[Orangutanion]: I literally just had one of my comments silently censored for 
calling dating apps a Ψop. See how I had to bypass the censorship there?
That’s another problem.  You censored yourself and I have 
legitimately no idea what you’re trying to say.  Yop?  Cop?  Slop?  
Trident-op?  Candle-op?  I can’t think of any offensive words that ends 
in -op.  I’m sure I’d understand what you meant if you didn’t censor 
yourself, but now I’m sitting here scratching my head.  So sometimes 
censoring words causes clarity to be lost.
ψ is a Greek letter known as psi, so the person is likely saying 
psyop. I have no clue why they self-censored that of all things, but I 
guess that's the world we live in now.
Yeah that. I had a comment with proof get filtered, and I'm pretty sure it's because I used the full word.

[marcusdipaola]: Social media and algorithms don't actually do that. I use NSFW 
words in my TikToks all the time and still get millions of views.
Maybe, but Elon has already stated X / Twitter’s policy is freedom
 of speech not freedom of reach and posts may be”deboosted or 
demonetized” in addition to being heavily automated in their filtering. 
Meta has been known to suppress posts based on their wording / 
terminology, it’s also coordinated with governments on this. YouTube’s 
“ad-pocalypse” was centered around the effort to clean up the content 
placed with ads and in practice demonetized creators based on their 
content.
I can’t speak to TikTok’s algorithm or where they draw their 
lines, but I’m almost willing to bet they exist. From what I can tell 
TikTok’s algorithm creates light echo chambers which could be why you 
feel less impacted.

[CarlotheNord]: That and you get banned from many places if you use big boy terms. Try and say the dreaded R word.
That one is a slur so I’m not surprised. We’re not talking about slurs here.
The fact you think it's a slur is very sad. I once had a moderator
 tell me I can't use that word, I have to use language I'd be ok with 
kids hearing, so stuff like swears are acceptable.
Bud, it's the swears I don't use around kids. and the "slurs" I do. This site is so backwards it's nuts.
I’m autistic. I am part of the group of people that is targeted 
when you use the word r*tarded. It is a slur. It is something people say
 to me to tell me that I don’t know what I’m talking about. It is used 
to dismiss me so that people who don’t want to listen to me about my 
needs when I’m trying to communicate them don’t have to. It’s also used 
by bullies in order to communicate to other bullies who their target 
should be. There is no excuse to be using it against anyone. Go ahead 
and call people stupid if you have to, if they genuinely are being 
stupid, but you can’t be making fun of disabled people like that.
I'm going to introduce you to the concept of the Euphemism 
Treadmill, and it is the reason why attempting to make words into no-no 
words is destined for failure. Because what you call a slur today, will 
be replaced tomorrow by whatever softer term you deem safe as an 
alternative.
I'm not going to argue this, you're going to imply that the word 
is only ever used as a derogatory term and somehow holds power over you.
 I advise you to remember that words cannot hurt you, they are not 
sticks and stones. Bullies will find new words, new words will have the 
same old meaning, this will continue forever. Toughen up a bit mate, 
it'll do you good.

[PM-Me-Your-Dragons]: Not only should we refuse to participate, but if they start using 
it in real life, we should correct what they’re saying. “No, its not 
ahh, you meant to say ASS. You sound like a child.”
ahh instead of ass isn't the best example as that's slang not censorship but yeah I agree
It’s slang that is censorship. It being slang doesn’t erase what 
it’s actually doing. The system uses it to encourage people not to swear
 so that people have to listen to their decorum. Maybe on its own it’s 
not that big of a deal, but I don’t like bowing to decorum for no reason
 in any case. Because once you give people an inch, they’ll take a mile.
 It’s possible to be genuine and communicative without censoring 
yourself. (That being said, because I know someone reading this thread 
who’s mad at me will tie my comments together, slurs are awful and serve
 no genuine purpose and nobody should use them.)
Not really people don't use ahh to censor themselves they use it 
because it's the hip thing to do. No context where you would be using 
ahh is one with high decorum anyway. The use of 'ahh' in place of ass is
 just a linguistic/cultural thing not a censorship thing. New slang gets
 developed all the time, it's not the same as using unalived instead of 
died or killed.
Secondly, things like graped instead of raped or unalived is not 
even really technically censoring anything. The meaning of the words 
remains largely the same, the information being conveyed is not really 
changed much at all so in that sense the self censorship isn't actually 
censoring anything either.
This 100% I say ahh because it sounds better to me, ass just 
sounds too blunt. I still say ass but in different context, for example 
when referring to my actual ass
I had a literal doctor say “unalive,” so yeah this is becoming a real life problem, not just on the internet anymore.

[NotaJelly]: It happens on this one, anytime I choose to use curse words I can

who have even seen it. On YouTube they straight pull your comments down 
sometimes and won't tell you.
[CrispyDave]: When you're letting social media decide how you express yourself maybe it's time to reconsider your use.

[----DragonFly----]: Censorship online.
Eventually people start saying it in real life.
[Jadams0108]: I get it in cases where if the platform has ai auto censoring, in any other case it just sounds dumb as fuck.
On a side note, I can’t look at the word grape, when used to censor the word rape,without immediately thinking of this classic video on YouTube
"its purple". 😂
[EE7A]: "its purple". 😂
[rogershredderer]: It comes off extremely childish and apathetic.
If you’re a content creator (which Gen Z and Gen Alpha are likely 
to be) you don’t have much choice as the algorithms may seek to 
terminate your career for use of the banned terminology.
Terms like “grape” or “corn” are not meant to be childish, they are literal work arounds against termination.
Why can’t they just sensor those words in the same way they’d 
sensor swears? I’ve seen a lot of YouTube videos who say those things 
but just bleep them out.
Why can’t they just sensor those words in the same way they’d sensor swears?
Idk, I guess it’s personal. If I was a content creator I’d just 
avoid the terminology altogether instead of trying to water it down.
Agreed, I think it’s more crappy to downplay those issues than to just not talk about them.
Because the algorithm can still flag you if it's bleeped.

[Objective-Try7969]: If TikTok doesn't like your comment you get a strike. For fucks 
sakes you can't even use a vomit emoji anymore. If you say even one it 
catches that it doesn't like, you get dinged and some reddits have been 
ramping up, I get blocked from commenting sometimes and I have to change
 my words for it to allow it to comment. On reddit I just get the (no 
endpoint) and it won't go through until you change the problematic word.
Have the self respect to delete TikTok
Literally
Exactly.
They can pry it from me, I don't use FB, I don't use insta, or 
twitter,  I literally only have this, tt, and blue sky, I'll keep being 
as billgerent as I can, and repost important videos because that's the 
only way real info is getting out right now. That's what they want, they
 want us off, less of us to repost the real news, less views, they want 
to silence us, getting off of tt is giving them exactly what they want, 
suppression
Tiktok was bought by Trump and is to be sold to Isreal. You should
 probably get off of it lmfao if you value any of the things you talk 
about. Also tiktok, Facebook, YouTube are not reliable resources for 
news. Use a VPN and look at news outlets from other countries about 
america. You'll shit your pants.

[Amphibious_cow]: I personally make an effort not to when it’s unnecessary, but many
 f us have been conditioned my algorithms to do so even when no 
censoring algorithm is present
[Ecstatic_Ad5542]: Because Instagram and Youtube shadow-ban users for using the actual terms?
I don't censor myself on reddit or internet forums and write the 
words rape and murder whenever I need to, only on meta owned apps with 
stupid restrictions. And even then I try not to use 'unalive' because it
 just sounds rude and instead write something like m××der or 
s><c/de.
[CrimsonArcPaladin]: Because the older generation got too sensitive and decided to 
censor or filter words on platforms, in which younger generations who 
are starting to interact with the real world, know what the word is/ 
means but censor it bc their digital self somewhat reflects their real 
self...in my understanding. As for me I say what I want to unless its a 
professional setting in which I dont mention or think of it at all
[HeavyIceCircuit]: Everyone I hear someone say it unironically in real life or on 
Reddit I just assume their screen time on social media is at least 12+ 
hours daily.
You have to be exposed to a word/term constantly to start adapting
 it in everyday language subconsciously. That’s how we learn languages 
growing up.
And even then, you have to let social media influence your life 
enough to use it outside of it. Nobody says most online exclusive lingo 
like “lmao” despite being exposed to it.
[No_Positive1855]: Because Tik Tok has a proprietary algorithm that can take down 
videos and comments if they use too many words like that, so people use 
fake words to be safe, such as "grape," "pew pew," "unalived," and 
"sewer slide."
Over time, people got so used to using the terms on Tik Tok that 
they crept into their real life conversation, becoming slang out of 
habit.
Most of these replies are about tiktok
Yes, that's the main cause, if not the only cause.  Although on 
Reddit, I'll say things like "end my life" instead of the s word because
 automod filter scripts have become more prevalent.  Depending on how 
strict of auto filtering the mods of a sub have enabled, your comment 
could get removed without even being reported or reviewed by a human

[LordTuranian]: Because shitty apps like TikTok make it so you have no choice but to censor yourself.
[ChapterSpecial6920]: Shadowbanning
It's to bypass the censorship algorithms on social media
[psychedelicpiper67]: As a millennial, I grew up with so much use of the word “kill” and
 “death” in children’s media. Even SpongeBob used those words. So yeah, I
 feel you.
The algorithms are definitely to blame for censorship of language,
 but it’s really cringe when people use what’s essentially newspeak in 
an actual conversation.
I had to tell a friend off MY AGE who used the word “unalive” with me once. Thankfully, he’s never said it since.
Social media is pretty much shaping us into an Orwellian society. 
What’s even more concerning is that TikTok is the main app that’s behind
 these policies, and they’re controlled by China, which is a communist 
dictatorship with concentration camps and next-to-no privacy.
As an autistic and very emotionally sensitive individual, I’m more
 triggered by this change in language than I am by “death”, “kill”, 
“suicide”, etc. It’s because my mind immediately thinks about all the 
dystopian crap behind this.
Back when I was a kid, there was this avatar chatroom game called 
zwinky. They added censors and a "family friendly server" that was 
heavily moderated and censored. The whole site died very shortly after 
due to members leaving in droves. I think all of the tiktok addicts 
should do the same. Just stop using it. When platforms start to die or 
lose money they start trying to stay afloat or they die. Let it die.
I really hate seeing gen z just bend over backwards to keep things
 shitty. The video app doesn't let you say fuck? Stop using it. They'll 
either let you say fuck or they'll die and you'll move onto a new app. 
Stop being so complacent. I used to see literal dicks on VINE back in 
2013.
Well Trump is buying TikTok now or something. We’ll see what 
happens. Hopefully that makes a lot of people leave. Although 
ironically, I’m pretty sure he’d allow swearing on there.

[electrifyingseer]: to avoid content getting removed. And to why they say it irl, its 
because the sanitized words only ever get talked about, leading to a 
cultural shift in self-sanitization. It's just the consequences of 
living in late-stage capitalism. And considering most people use memes 
from tiktok, its only natural that people end up sanitizing themselves 
because people on tiktok have to censor their content to avoid getting 
removed.
It's not too hard to understand why, even if it's horrifying to see.
[TrollCannon377]: A lot of it is to bypass auto ban systems that remove comments if certain words are detected
[BackgroundTime8298]: Those were started by content creators like true crime YouTubers 
that were trying to avoid being demonetized from the use of those words.
 Which is stupid anyway cause why even talk about those topics if you’re
 not gonna take it serious in the first place. These words caught on and
 regular people in the internet started using those words in the 
internet for some stupid reason as if they are were worried about 
demonetized.
Now it’s spreading though life. I know people who are inorically saying grape when we have serious conversations.
[B19Wing]: It’s because platforms have stupid filters on them
[ripMyTime0192]: Grape and corn are stupid, and the first one’s harmful because it 
almost minimizes it a bit. I kinda like unalive though when it’s used 
ironically.
[Feeling-Currency6212]: People do it because they don’t want to trigger or offend someone.
[[deleted]]: Shit they don't censor themselves enough if you ask me.
[brownieandSparky23]: Censoring is lowkey fun. I do sometimes.
Like how the people over atr/horse_decimator_9000censor the word "h*rse"
Yea that’s strange.

TÍTULO: Will Gen Alpha be more conservative and religious than us? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Years of social media completely controlled by the so called 
"progressive" until 2022 and we overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2024. 
Will Gen Alpha men have more conservative values than our men?
They're going to be growing up in a world where all big social 
medias have republicans influencing the algorithm; X, Tiktok, Facebook, 
Instagram.
Top podcast are also conservative leaning men.
Top streamers are also conservative leaning men
Most known athletes with the exception of Lebron are conservative
Most rappers are conservative
Late Gen Z is already using derogatory terms  that the core Gen Z avoided to not be "offensive"
I'm very concerned for our country as conservatives are in the rise every part of the world.
What can we redditors do to save the world in the next 8 years
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[slingshot19]: In my opinion Gen Alpha will be more polarized and incoherent than
 Gen Z is. In other words, may god have mercy on politics.
Agreed, the internet as it’s been is now has really worsened the 
divide. The algorithms, the echo chambers, and how a lot of the media 
tries to upset people because that gets clicks. I don’t know how this 
will affect gen alpha in the long run, but I assume there will be more 
division.
Doesn’t help that a sizable chunk of them has been raised on 
mindmelting YouTube kids stuff since they were babies. I feel bad for 
Gen Alpha, really. I feel lucky that my baby brother (technically late 
Gen Z but grew up with Alpha) is pretty normal
Yeah and I really hope that gen z parents will be better prepared 
to keep our kids away from that stuff. I have some friends that have a 5
 year old and they’ll be getting her a tablet for Christmas (not iPad 
but something similar) but all that will be on it is like Netflix kids 
and some mobile games. And they’ll be monitoring everything and only let
 her have it for short periods as a reward for good behavior. So it’s 
nice to see that some parents are learning to approach these things more
 responsibly.

[tyrannosaurus_gekko]: "We overwhelmingly voted for trump in 2024" bro what are you smoking? And can I have some?
Like, sure he won the popular vote, but who the hell is "we"?
[snickers000]: Like, sure he won the popular vote, but who the hell is "we"?
[Guilty_Raise8212]: The problem with all of this is that you always think in these 
patterns of conservative vs progressive or whatever. In the end, 
everyone is on a spectrum and labeling stuff like this doesn't help; 
What is it that you are really worried about? That people will go back 
to being religious? That values will change?
Yes, I am worried that I’ll spend the remainder of my life hounded by little shits telling me to find Jesus.
You won’t.
[EpsilonBear]: Yes, I am worried that I’ll spend the remainder of my life hounded by little shits telling me to find Jesus.
You won’t.
[Meredith_Apple57]: You won’t.
[No_Artichoke_8428]: Most likely, although gen beta will probably be more liberal than 
millennials just like the past cycle we have seen with past generations.
Most polls show gen z and alpha being left wing
It depends on the poll as sides will focus on the trends that look
 good for them (if you torture statistics you can get them to say 
anything you want as the saying goes).
The right try to claim gen Z and gen Alpha just because they lean 
right on a few specific cultural issues (DEI/equity, trans bathrooms, 
mass migration etc.) that apparently makes them "right wing".
Even though these same people will be pro-choice, pro-worker, pro-gay marriage atheist's but the right ignore those parts.

[practice_spelling]: If something is enough dominant they’ll probably rebel against it (or one could hope in this case).
[Meredith_Apple57]: Yeah, trump is unpopular with us and we never even voted for him
[felya]: Just focus on yourself bro. Quit driving yourself crazy thinking about things you have zero control over.
[urethrafranklin97]: They'll 100% be easier to sway and manipulate so its not looking great in terms of politics for them.
[crunchylimestones]: Yeah most definitely. Hopefully that's paired with an excellent 
and updated knowledge of theology, science and philosophy (as it 
frequently is these days) but we're can only hope
Nope.
Nope what? You disagree that it's going to happen?
[Meredith_Apple57]: Nope.
Nope what? You disagree that it's going to happen?
[crunchylimestones]: Nope what? You disagree that it's going to happen?
[evileide]: Conservative? No. Edgy? Yes.
[MaulerX]: I think religiousness will become "extinct" in western nations 
within a few more generations. We have access to human knowledge in our 
pocket. There are too many unanswerable questions about religion. Each 
new generation is getting smarter as well.
The only thing we will have to replace when religion goes out the 
door is an excuse to gather on a weekly or semi regular bases and 
socialize. Think of the church groups and different events the church 
put on. At some points in history, church is where you found your 
wife/husband. It was a good place to meet quality people. Not at bars 
where people get driunk and do other dumb shit.
[Lopsided_Constant901]: I think majority of Gen Z and into Gen Alpha feel like the culture
 war stuff is all in the past for the most part. Until Trump reverses 
Same Sex marriage, or outright tries rounding up trans people, it's in 
an alright place. I think we all see how fucked we got economically 
though, and how this ruling class generation totally had 0 regard for 
the future we are living in. I hope we are able to band together 
Generationally, cause really, Millenials, Gen Z, Gen Alpha all agree on a
 ton of things legally speaking. Gay people should marry/ be able to be 
in the military, freedom of speech, legalizing cannabis. We just haven't
 had the leadership to be aggressive enough with things we actually care
 about.
I hope the next President is like our Generation's Obama but way further left.
[LordTuranian]: Nah, they will be 50/50 like Gen Z with half the people being very
 conservative and religious and half the people being the opposite.
[daffy_M02]: 

[ZhiYoNa]: We’re barreling toward war. They want a violent population. The cruelty is the point
Don’t let them think we imagine we are going to war. He wants one that doesn’t mean he will get one
[Souledex]: Don’t let them think we imagine we are going to war. He wants one that doesn’t mean he will get one
[60TIMESREDACTED]: Maybe, maybe not. Opinions are constantly shifting
[ImmigrationJourney2]: Hopefully
[TrashApocalypse]: It seems like the more internet a generation consumes, the more gullible they become, so, yeah.
[Kaenu_Reeves]: This is sadly bait. Zoomers voted for Trump the most out of any generation.
Lies, they voted the least out of any generation. Please stop speading disinformation
Well, out of the Zoomers who actually voted, they voted Trump the 
least. But it’s true that Zoomers rarely actually vote. It’s common for 
all young people
[Correct-Pangolin-568]: Lies, they voted the least out of any generation. Please stop speading disinformation

[MissNibbatoro]: Hopefully
[Netblock]: It's just a very good example demonstrating my point.
I'm asking you to list examples, so far you've given one (sorta now two). Do you have any other examples?
Addressing that is entirely about helping women.
I disagree; have you looked in queer spaces? As a member of those 
corners I can say with confidence that they are filled to the brim with 
people who are dissecting things they want and do not want with respect 
to their own gender.
For example, do you know what a "femboy" is? "Femboys" are men who
 wish to be soft, effeminate, and embrace all the cutesy plushie girly 
stuff, who otherwise still wish to be called men.
They're not doing it for the benefit of women or anyone else. 
They're doing it because they truly want what's right for them.
The ultimate goal of trans and nonbinary gender ideology is that 
everything about gender should be a choice, and not something forced 
upon you, like what the conservatives want to do.
[HexxRx]: There’s nothing we can do. Conservative behavior is aggressive and oppressive
It’s dying out. trump is polling horribly with young ppl
For two completely different reasons he's either not going far enough or he's going too far
[Meredith_Apple57]: It’s dying out. trump is polling horribly with young ppl

[Meredith_Apple57]: Gen Z voted for Kamala lol
[Correct-Pangolin-568]: "We overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2024" This is a lie. A plain
 lie, debunked by statistics. Young people voted Trump the least out of 
any generation
[LegitimateUmpire4]: Performative Gen Z ‘woke’ lefties have no idea the shit storm 
they’ve caused. Society will bend the knee to forms of ‘woke’ ideology 
whilst the majority of its subscribers are in their 20s but as time goes
 on and it becomes apparent that the next generation of young people 
don’t subscribe to it then society as a whole will quickly kick that 
shit to the curb and gutter stomp it, the thing is by this point a lot 
of Right Wing parties will be doing everything they can to mix 
legitimate left wing progressive ideas with the more ludicrous and 
performative ones, this is the kicker social stigma might even at this 
point be used against the Left.


Spends too much time on social media:

COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[GamingTatertot]: All well and good, except a lot of hobbies and communities are now digital / virtual.
That being said, I’d definitely recommend anyone here to look for local clubs, young adult sports, anything of that nature
Unfortunately most places don't have small clubs, adult sports 
leagues, and stuff like that. Pretty much only like a big metropolitan 
city thing
I mean, I don’t know about that. I’d also wager most people here 
live in close proximity to some type of population center.
Even my small city I was born and raised in has everything I just listed.
Exactly.
Go on Meetup and plenty of groups now do Online calls only.
Many event pages and other social groups are through Discord.
Some concerts are even digital/VR.
This was all worsened by declining third spaces and especially 
from Covid, where Online versions of previously live events converted to
 digital and didn’t look back.
There will need to be actual larger scale healthy cultural and 
educational social changes as many Gen Z have grown up with digital 
schooling and social groups and thus now have a culture that actively 
encourages it and actively discourages the formation of real life groups
 and it will only get worse before it gets better.
Can’t really help with communities but I found art is a really good non digital hobby if your medium isn’t digital.
Also reading, good old physical books are quite good ways to move away from digital hobbies.
I also found the gym is a great thing to get you out the house. 
Although I haven’t gone in like a month as I had surgery recently and 
the lead up to it I couldn’t walk properly lol

[Lower_Kick268]: A lot of areas really don't have much to do unless you wanna drive
 far and spend money, id rather just stay home at that point and save 
the money.
I hear you, but then rather than social media, go write, go play 
music, really anything that is creative and creates meaning!
I hate writing
My friend I used to play in a band with is in college far away
Your second point indicates well how our atomised societies are effecting the building of social communities.
People move for college and then for work and then move again for 
the house they buy, causing even the strongest of social groups to 
split-upunlesspeople stay in one place, which then severely 
limits their education/career/housing options because many Universities 
stay in one branch in one city for the “prestige”/reputation and online 
schooling causes one to be isolated from the campus’ community.
Our car/city-centric designed societies also means that city 
centres are where all the third spaces and social groups are and 
suburbia, city outskirts and towns are often isolated from these 
communities.
All I can do is wish you good luck.
Crazy that the reason you can’t play music is because someone else
 isn’t there. I can tell that no matter what anyone says to you it’ll 
never be good enough lol

stay in one branch in one city for the “prestige”/reputation and online 
schooling causes one to be isolated from the campus’ community.
Our car/city-centric designed societies also means that city 
centres are where all the third spaces and social groups are and 
suburbia, city outskirts and towns are often isolated from these 
communities.

Crazy that the reason you can’t play music is because someone else
 isn’t there. I can tell that no matter what anyone says to you it’ll 
never be good enough lol
[Lower_Kick268]: I hate writing
My friend I used to play in a band with is in college far away
Your second point indicates well how our atomised societies are effecting the building of social communities.
People move for college and then for work and then move again for 
the house they buy, causing even the strongest of social groups to 
split-upunlesspeople stay in one place, which then severely 
limits their education/career/housing options because many Universities

Agreed!!! I’m trying my best to help people that are on the fence about it
Social media has done nothing but grow since its inception. You are talking right now on a social media site
Uh huh. This is why it's dying.
Boring content.
I just told you that it isn't dying

[MFavinger22]: Not gonna lie you make great points. I just don’t have much 
intrinsic curiosity to do new things. Nothing interests me anymore man, 
even when I was younger passions/ hobbies lose value after a couple 
months
Don’t lose hope dude, I think the issue is you’re just super 
desensitized now due to the constant stimulation. That’s not a normal 
brain state though it’s an artificial one. Thus, without enough time and
 effort you can return your brain back to how it was before all the 
nonsense. If you’re open to it, I’d love to try and help you with this
Oh yeah I don’t disagree with you at all. I’ve done a couple 
different things (deleted all social media besides Reddit) and really 
tried to use my phone less. I have friends and a social life I just 
think my issue stems from depression. It’s a Friday and all I wanna do 
is sleep 😂

--- DOCUMENTO: “Why is Gen Z moving to the Right_” _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: “Why is Gen Z moving to the Right?” : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
No, we’re not brainwashed by too much Andrew Tate, social media, 
and the YouTube algorithm. For the love of God, if you see an entire 
generation shifting to the right, perhaps you should stop and consider 
the conditions that are leading them there. You shouldn’t assume they’re
 a generation of mindless fools who are being misled. Instead, consider 
the world they’ve grown up in, and think about what they might be trying
 to regain that they feel like they’ve lost
Don’t call Gen Z men and boys “uneducated, close-minded, incel 
virgins.” Don’t accuse Gen Z women and girls of doing it all for male 
validation or attention. We know exactly what we’re doing, we’re not 
gullible toddlers.
I feel like ever since the United States election, there have been
 so many posts in this sub and many others, asking why this generation 
is moving to the right, and everyone seems to think that it’s because 
we’ve been manipulated by our social media algorithms and can’t think 
for ourselves.
I’ll tell you this, I don’t consider myself left-wing, not at all.
 I made that decision on my own. I grew up in Canada, I still live here,
 and I will always love my country, but I hate what it has become. I 
can’t recognize it anymore. The place where I grew up, it’s not the 
same. It’s changed beyond recognition, and now there are only glimmers 
of what once was. It was stolen from me.
I don’t care if you think the right isn’t going to fix anything. 
The fact is, the left isn’t going to do it either. They’ve proven that 
over many years. The left has been in power for a long time, and I’m 
sick of them. You can only mess up so many times before we can no longer
 forgive or forget.
Also, while I’m at it, you all should really consider why people 
like Andrew Tate went viral to begin with. What caused it? No, teenage 
boys aren’t stupid, they’re not unloveable losers, they were looking for
 something that wasn’t being given to them in the real world, and 
frankly, still isn’t.
We will continue to move to the right, and you will continue to 
lose elections, until you all take a long, hard look in the mirror and 
figure out what’s wrong with yourselves.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[walkandtalkk]: How did you write seven paragraphs and say absolutely nothing?
You don't saywhat"the left" did. It's just a lot of 
vaguebooking and, yes, incelly seething. (Canada "was stolen from me." 
"You can only mess up so many times before we can no longer forgive or 
forget.")
I think you may well be a troll account, given that you were set 
up two months ago and seem determined to hit every vague trope. If not, 
you should explain your argument well or go to bed.
Also, what is it exactly that Andrew Tate offers young men that 
isn’t given to them in the real world? Oh wait, I know. It’s a sense of 
entitlement to women’s bodies and power over them.

[NotACommie24]: The answer is way more simple than that.
The democrats haven’t evolved. Everyone sees them as corporate 
democrats still. The republicans have evolved, and embraced populism. 
They directly craft what they say to appeal to voters. The democrats 
don’t. If they did, we would probably see the exact opposite, as the 
democrats better align on issues that our generation almost unanimously 
supports. Lgbt rights, women’s rights, higher taxes on corporations and 
the top earners, public sector spending on healthcare and education, 
better wages, etc
"OMG I can't believe Kamala lost! She ran a perfect campaign! It's those racist and sexist white and Latino men!"
Kamala's Campaign message: I will do nothing, Trump bad.
Trump Campaign: I will do everything, America good.
Voters voted for the person who said he was gonna do something 
over the person who said they would nothing, what a shocker lmao
That’s my point. Kamala lost because she ran a shit campaign and 
was completely unwilling to distance her policy from Biden. Most voters 
didn’t like the state of the country, so yeah, no shit the person 
running on more of the same is gonna lose miserably.
If she was willing to take a more aggressive approach in issues 
that most voters care about like healthcare, worker rights, union 
protections, a more fair tax system, etc, she would’ve destroyed Trump. 
All that said, I am optimistic that losing to Trump twice will be the 
kick in the balls that the DNC needs to realize they have to change if 
they want to remain a viable political party.

Any sort of leftist populist (that avoids calling themselves a 
socialist or Communist) would win an election in a landslide. But that 
wouldn't be good for the Dem corporate doners so it's not happening.

Yeah... no. There may be some democrats who woke up to how fucking
 dumb their platform is, but a lot are still under the impression it was
 because of sexism/racism that Kamala lost. The DNC would have to 
reinvent it's entire platform, which they are not doing as of right now,
 and if they were to start, they should have started right after the 
election.
It's not gonna be until 2032 that we see any sort of change with the Democrats.
Kamala's Campaign message: I will do some good things and not 
destroy the country, Trump was the president already and he was really 
bad it.
Trump Campaign: I'm going to do a lot of bad things but they're 
going to be the best because I'm the best and they're actually good 
things because we're the best.
The voters are morons (which isn't a shocker either)
Voters are morons with a 2 week memory, but Kamala also ran a horrendously bad campaign.
She did, but not for the reasons this guy said.
They aren’t like entirely wrong tho. Just off the top of my head, 
the two big policies she talked about were extending the child tax 
credit (pretty good), and a $25k tax rebate for first time home buyers 
(bad)
The tax credit one was fucking stupid. The problem with housing 
isnt something $25k is going to solve. Housing prices would just 
increase to reflect that tax rebate anyways. The problem is corporate 
ownership, not enough condensed housing, not enough units being built to
 reflect the population growth, and services like AirBNB and Vrbo 
encouraging wealthy people to buy properties they dont need. She didn’t 
talk about literally any of those if memory serves, but I could be 
wrong.
Dude the other part of the tax credit was building 3 million more 
homes and cutting red tape that blocks new construction. People 
literally just did not listen to what she was saying.
Oh well my mistake for that. Regardless, I generally do agree that
 she ran a very poor campaign, mainly because she wasn’t willing to 
distance herself from Biden enough.
Kamala was asked on The View if she would change anything from the Biden administration. Guess what she said? "
"No."
You can't run on "Orange man bad" if you don't give voters hope. 
Trump ran on "Biden/Kamala bad" but also gave voters hope.
The voters are morons
Yeah that's also why the Dems lost. Calling voters idiots just 
because they didn't vote how you like is not a winning strategy. It 
comes off as incredibly pompous and elitist, because it is.

Based af. Biden’s presidency was unexpectedly amazing and better even than Obama’s. I want more of that please
Yeah that’s also why the Dems lost.
This doesn’t mean anything. This is just a thought-terminating 
cliche. If someone says X, responding with “saying X is why the Dems 
lost” is not only just random speculation based on nothing; it also 
doesn’t do anything to refute X.
Trump ran on "Biden/Kamala bad" but also gave voters hope.
No amount of "Kamala bad" is an excuse for voting Trump. Everyone 
made their decision. His presidency is going to be a disaster and it was
 extremely predictable. This is what makes them morons.

Yeah, thoughts like these are why Dems got their ass handed to them.
Maybe stop blaming the majority of voters for the failures of campaign staff.
They have evolved, Democrats just don’t want to win unless they 
can do it on their terms. They don’t believe in democracy. They think 
that young people are stupid and spoiled for wanting universal 
healthcare and believing that Palestinians are people. They literally 
chose to continue carrying out a genocide rather than listening to their
 base and giving people ANY reason to vote for them.
How do they not believe in democracy?

homes and cutting red tape that blocks new construction. People 
literally just did not listen to what she was saying.
Oh well my mistake for that. Regardless, I generally do agree that
 she ran a very poor campaign, mainly because she wasn’t willing to 
distance herself from Biden enough.

[Better_Green_Man]: Kamala was asked on The View if she would change anything from the Biden administration. Guess what she said? "
"No."
You can't run on "Orange man bad" if you don't give voters hope. 
Trump ran on "Biden/Kamala bad" but also gave voters hope.
The voters are morons
Yeah that's also why the Dems lost. Calling voters idiots just 
because they didn't vote how you like is not a winning strategy. It 
comes off as incredibly pompous and elitist, because it is.
Kamala was asked on The View if she would change anything from the Biden administration. Guess what she said? “
“No.”
Based af. Biden’s presidency was unexpectedly amazing and better even than Obama’s. I want more of that please
Yeah that’s also why the Dems lost.
This doesn’t mean anything. This is just a thought-terminating 
cliche. If someone says X, responding with “saying X is why the Dems 
lost” is not only just random speculation based on nothing; it also 
doesn’t do anything to refute X.
Trump ran on "Biden/Kamala bad" but also gave voters hope.
No amount of "Kamala bad" is an excuse for voting Trump. Everyone 
made their decision. His presidency is going to be a disaster and it was
 extremely predictable. This is what makes them morons.

Yeah, thoughts like these are why Dems got their ass handed to them.
Maybe stop blaming the majority of voters for the failures of campaign staff.

[Exotic-Television-44]: They have evolved, Democrats just don’t want to win unless they 
can do it on their terms. They don’t believe in democracy. They think 
that young people are stupid and spoiled for wanting universal 
healthcare and believing that Palestinians are people. They literally 
chose to continue carrying out a genocide rather than listening to their
 base and giving people ANY reason to vote for them.
How do they not believe in democracy?
[NotACommie24]: How do they not believe in democracy?
[Strawhat_Max]: This whole rant literally did nothing lmaooo
Literally and I ask the same question, I think more of the young 
men in the generation are leaning right and it’s because of how 
alienated they feel. Young women in our generation are still actively 
liberal ( which I obviously love to see but they become too radical and 
simply push men further away .)

[Exotic-Television-44]: Liberals aren’t the left. Liberals have been in power, but they 
are capitalists and fundamentally still on the right. It doesn’t matter 
if it’s woke capitalism or anti-woke capitalism, we’re on a track 
towards alienation and disintegration of society because the economic 
system driving our society is singularly focused on extracting as much 
value out of people as is physically possible, without consideration for
 any human needs.
And please don’t act like the right is offering a solution to all 
this shit, because they’re not. Immigrants aren’t the cause of every bad
 thing in the world, it’s the ruling class made up of pedophile ghouls.

[Throwmeaway199676]: Voting for Trump was a dumb decision regardless of what generation
 you're in lmao. It's like if you stubbed your toe and decided the best 
treatment would be to shoot yourself in the foot with a shotgun.
Andrew Tate got popular because he's extremely talented at what he
 does: an entertainer grifting a vulnerable audience by preying on their
 insecurities. This whole post reeks of cope. The left didn't make you 
do anything. Don't blame the left for your beliefs. Be a grown up and 
own them.
[Waste_Vacation2321]: I mean, I lean more to the left because all I see on the right is 
people wanting to take away my, and my friends, and people in 
community's rights. I volunteer for my country's left wing party. But I 
can also see why people go to the right.  We're living in a time of 
uncertainty and so much change, and the 'olden days' seem easier.  Which
 they probably were, providing you don't fall into a minority or don't 
mind hiding yourself. I also think a lot of people on the left, 
including people I hang around (and I admit it, even myself sometimes) 
can be very quick to judge and just expect people to see their POV 
without explaining it, and even then, they expect people to immediately 
jump to the left. I also think that left "allies" of communities can be 
very racist, homophobic, sexist, ect. purely because they're so scared 
of not being that, or they think they're not because they vote for the 
left and therefore have nothing to work through. I say this as a 
bisexual woman, people on the right tend to not care as much as long as 
you're a good person (or they just come out and say they don't like a 
group, or they pretend not to care but say it behind closed doors), 
whereas people on the left will go out of their way to impress even when
 you don't want it, or they will ask invasive questions as a way of 
trying to educate themselves.  I welcome questions, but some that I get 
are pretty gross, especially when I've just met a person. In saying 
that, I think left-leaning political parties are in general a lot 
better, although I am associating the right with American politics right
 now and all I can see is that country being run by a fascist dictator. 
 So I may be a little biased.
The real problem with “the left” is that they are incapable of 
offering a real alternative to the the right which is violently racist, 
homophobic, sexist, etc. Democrats in America are still capitalists, 
believe in endless wars, and love corporations. It’s hard to fight 
against the fascists when you believe 99% of the same things as them.
Oh I completely agree, and actually think that the Democrats are 
middle-right and not actually a truly left-wing party (at least compared
 to independents, or a lot of other western countries).  The only good 
thing I see about the Democrats right now is that they're not Trump. 
Note: even our left-leaning major party in Australia is more central as 
well so this isn't just an American issue. I also think that a lot of 
people on the left will condemn bad things, again without offering any 
real solutions.
Fully agreed that they’re center-right. I know what you mean that 
they’re better than Trump, but they’re also completely incapable of 
effectively combatting him and block any actual popular movements that 
would have a chance. It’s not entirely hopeless though, I’ve been 
getting more involved in actual left-wing grassroots politics since the 
election, and I’m really hoping that the chaos of Trump 2 will push 
people to engage more in their communities and try to find real 
alternatives with their neighbors, coworkers, family, and other 
comrades.
The right isn’t actually violently racist, homophobic, or sexist. 
That’s what you’ve been told because they want you to be afraid of your 
neighbours.
No they absolutely are not (always) violently "_"-phobic.  But 
they can be.  My friends have been violently kicked out because the 
people they live with are so against them being gay, or trans, or 
whatever. But most right leaning people either are apathetic to or only 
against it behind closed doors. I'm not sure if this is targeted towards
 me or not, but I have many coworkers, neighbors and friends with more 
right -leaning beliefs and while I don't flaunt my sexuality like I 
would around my more leftist friends, I've never felt the need to hide 
it. Neither have any of the people I know outside of high school when 
they were living with their parents and we had very little life 
experience.
They still voted for a rapist that demonizes immigrants and trans people.
There are currently states trying to reverse gay marriage - Those 
states are all deep red. Unlike in 2008, it’s not California and New 
York anymore. So yes, I would say the Republican party is quite 
emphatically homophobic while the Democrats no longer are

Might as well sign off 2028 to Vance right now.
America elected a black man twice. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It’s a sad excuse.
Yep. They really have no idea.
It also just elected an adjudicated rapist for a second term. 
Denying the role of misogyny in American politics is intellectually 
pathetic.

Oh yeah, she also said rape is sexy. So yes, I have and will continue to believe she is fucking batshit crazy.
JD Vance will never win an election as the head of ticket because 
he’s a slimy little freak of a man. Trump at least has some sort of sick
 charisma.
Also, it’s fucking ridiculous to pretend that misogyny isn’t a factor in Trump winning. He’s literally a fucking rapist.

He won’t. He’s a vile little worm that hates poor people.

Still falling for the Dem propaganda is so funny.
Literally the only thing they can throw at JD is calling him 
"weird." Meanwhile, in every interview he seems like the most normal and
 smart dude you could find. Literally every single time he has made a 
public speaking appearance, people have gotten to like him more.
He is a fucking weirdo, and I fucking hate the Democrats so try

[Strawhat_Max]: Woefully misinformed and having no sense of longevity is the reason
[[deleted]]: The left is just as racist as the right, just in different ways. 
Right-wingers at least are open about it, while left-wingers hide theirs
 behind a façade of friendship.
They don’t see us as individuals, just a demographic to be 
exploited for votes. Their so-called advocacy is nothing more than a 
calculated strategy to maintain power, turning us non-white people into 
political pawns while pretending to be our friends.
Liberals aren’t leftists
I know, that’s why I am talking about leftists.
Then I don’t understand. Your critique is true for liberals, but 
not leftists. Can you give an example of an actual leftist doing what 
you’re talking about?
You’re assuming that only liberals engage in this behavior, but 
I’ve seen plenty of self-proclaimed leftists do the same thing. Many 
leftists like to think they’re above this kind of exploitation, but in 
practice, they often treat marginalized groups as tools for their 
movement rather than as individuals with their own perspectives.
Look at how some leftists react when a non-white person disagrees 
with them. Instead of engaging with the argument, they’ll dismiss that 
person as ‘brainwashed’, ‘reactionary’, or a ‘traitor.’ And if that 
person still doesn’t fall in line, they won’t hesitate to use outright 
racist language. Just look at how Latinos who voted for Trump were 
called slurs and derogatory names by people who claim to be anti-racist.
 The moment we step outside their ideological expectations, their 
supposed ‘solidarity’ disappears.
Leftism, especially in the West, often ends up being a thing white
 people engage with to please other white people. It’s less about actual
 change and more about virtue signaling to their peers that they’re on 
the ‘right side of history’. That’s why so many leftist spaces feel 
performative, because they’re built more around internal white social 
dynamics than any real engagement with marginalized communities.
So no, this isn’t just a liberal problem. The right may be openly 
hostile, but the left often disguises its own condescension as support. 
The result is the same: dehumanization, just with different branding.

[Advanced_Reveal8428]: Just so we know where the bar is, here are a few recent quotes from Republican members of Congress/Senate.
“These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in 
the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters…"  - Clay Higgins (R
“Representative Ilhan Omar of Somalia — I mean  Minnesota.” - MGT
And an article about a meeting they had to have in private to tell Republicans to stop making comments about her race/sex.
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-leaders-urge-party-members-against-racist-and-sexist-attacks-on-harris
Then there's this guy (Sen Tom Tuberville R-Ala) speaking at a trump rally
"They want crime. They want crime, because they want to take over 
what you got. They want to control what you have," Tuberville told the 
crowd. "They want reparation becausethey think the people that do the crimeare owed that. Bulls---. They are not owed that."
Apparently all black people are criminals according to senator tuberville..
Democrats are pretty garbage as well but I feel like the 
Republicans have really embraced the whole blatant racism thing to an 
extraordinary extent...
so if you could ...
I would love to hear some specific reasons, examples etc that lead
 you to believe the left is "more toxic" and "incredibly racist"..
[Independent_Box_8117]: 😭 Why do we black people lack support from either parties? This shit sucks
[daffy_M02]: Gen Z listens to elder people’s experiences that do not match today’s reality.
[Otherwise_Ratio430]: Why would politicians lose? You wont make anyone pay orher than 
your self. Politicians by definition need to succeed so if something 
doesnt work, you just produce candidates that are more in line with what
 seems to work. You can draw whatever conclusions you want from that.
You could even have two right parties, just one less right than the other
[soozerain]: The pendulum swings in the other direction.
Progressives like Robin Diangelo have far more sway on the left 
then people care to admit. And though she’s one person, she’s emblematic
 off the kind of talk that just drives white people crazy.
As it would any race. You can’t make podcasts with passive 
aggressive titles like “nice white parents”, aggressive ones about white
 tears or white guilt like the aforementioned diangelo or articles in 
the New Yorker about how maybe white parents sjoildnt adopt black 
children because they can’t raise them authentically black or understand
 their experiences as black Americans.
All of that stuff leaks into the atmosphere and people become aware of it. Fox Newslovesto find stuff like this and put it under big headlines.  Remember the guy they had on who was like a moderator on antiwork lol
All that to say, it gets back to people who shouldn’t hear it and 
then it makes them less likely to feel welcomed or open to the 
Democratic Party.
That’s my theory on at least some of the reason the left has lost white gen z voters.
[saguaroslim]: You’re all still missing the point: the fighting is what they 
want. Them, the billionaires. Believe whatever you want for yourself, 
live your life however you’re happiest, but quit waging war against your
 fellow 99% just because some tools in an office are telling you there’s
 a “culture war” or “our country used to be great.” Focus on helping the
 people around you and less on spreading anger online
[UnimpressedVulcan]: Personally I think people are reading too much into things for the following reasons:
exit polls, like all forms of data gathering has its fair share of criticism.
there was a general right wing shift not just with Gen Z.
lots of gen z didn’t vote. This matters because elections are more
 about turning out your base than anything else. Trump got his base, 
Charlie Kirk mid day on election out on his socials that turn out wasn’t
 where it needed to be so go out to vote and remember to drag your 
friends! The left wing base didn’t vote.
99% of the market data on the issues and values that Gen Z care 
about still suggest them being incredibly liberal on most issues.
Kamala campaign didn’t use Biden to campaign in working class 
areas in the rust belt that his popular in. Kamala didn’t tap into 
Bidens strong relationship with Unions. Kamala’s campaign practically 
muted Tim Walz and didn’t let him showcase who he was. Kamala campaign 
paraded around with Liz Cheney running as republicans lite. Kamala ran a
 “resume campaign”, the same mistake Hillary made imo. Voters don’t care
 about resumes anymore. Obama made the point in 2008 that experience 
alone doesn’t make up for other qualities and was proven right and won. 
So that has been settled since.
a lot of Trump voters I’ve talked to of all generations seem to 
think Trump was genuine when he distanced himself from Project 2025. 
Except well now he’s going forward with that exact agenda.
Really I just don’t buy the argument that Gen Z is inherently more
 right wing. Just the ones who are were motivated to show up, and some 
the more normally apathetic ones may have been misinformed and such.
[[deleted]]: Canada, eh? Yeah, I don't like what this place has become, either. I'm going to leave it for greener pastures.

Every morning, I post a short story or reflection about what it’s

next.

COVID has literally changed me but for the better I believe. I 
just turned 21 had a good 7/8 months of unhinged fresh 21 year old 
activities then the world shut down.  I will admit I accrued a little 
debt during the pandemmy but it’s only cause I used my time to go to 
school and pick up a trade. Unemployment could’ve covered it but no lie 
even tho I had a great job before… I’ve never seen that much money 
before so I blew it lol. If anything I was changed for the better 
learned a lot about myself. Not to say there weren’t hard times , I 
uncovered old wounds that I was hiding from and healed them. I was on my
 way to a burnout with no recovery. Got so close to myself during that 
time and honestly I’m happy I found light in that dark time.

Something I’ve been thinking about is how our generation can go 
from super motivated to completely drained in a matter of days. One 
minute we’re talking about chasing dreams, traveling, starting 
businesses, creating art and the next minute we’re mentally exhausted 
from just existing. It’s strange because wewantto be hopeful. We want to build things, improve ourselves, grow, learn, evolve.But
 at the same time, the pressure, the world, and our own minds make it 
hard to stay consistent. What makes it even weirder is that everyone 
else looks like they’re handling it perfectly. People online are “always
 grinding,” always successful, always positive but we never see the days
 when they want to disappear under a blanket and ignore everything.
The moments that help the most are the ones where people admit 
they’re struggling too. When someone says, “Yeah, I’m tired,” or “I 
can’t keep up right now,” it hits different. Even just being around 
others who are honest about their highs and lows makes you feel less 
broken.It doesn’t have to be some big group or official place just 
somewhere you can talk, share, or vibe without pretending you’re okay 
24/7.
Gen Z isn’t weak. We’re just carrying a lot, and we’re finally brave enough to say it.
So here’s my question:
Are you more optimistic or more burned out these days and what triggers it for you?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:

Its weird I feel like our generation knows everything about mental
 health, burnout, capitalism, relationships, boundaries, whatever… and 
yet none of us are actually okay.
I was playing on my phone last night, scrolling through videos 
about “how to rest properly,” while literally too anxious to rest. Like 
I’m self diagnosing in 4K but still ignoring the cure. It’s like we’ve 
unlocked every cheat code to understand whats wrong with us, but not a

talk about them too much and still can’t function

Take care of yourself and those around you so well that the

[rogershredderer]: Anyone else feel like being hyper-aware made life harder instead of easier?
Generally speaking, yea. You’re typically not supposed to have 
unlimited access to entertainment & technology from a young age.
[SleepyMitcheru]: You said you were looking for answers to something you are dealing
 with, so it’s not that your awareness of this stuff caused it. Seems 
like you are conflating things a bit here, being, self-awareness, 
awareness, and research.
It’s been long known that those with a curious mind seem to be 
more emotionally distressed by life, or at least more expressive about 
their feelings on things, but you can’t really unaware an aware mind 
while still living.
Buddhism for instance from a mental health perspective appears to 
primarily exist for the suffering of conscious, it’s an attempt at 
something close to “unawaring”,  however it’s a bit of the opposite, 
it’s understanding that actually helps.
So this isn’t something new, emotions used to be suppressed, even 
as far as oppressed often I’d say, which is why we see more cases, it’s 
like digging up gold and thinking you are making gold by digging, no 
people are more knowledgeable on this stuff because people have always 
been suffering these emotions, the only difference now is that they have
 words to power and ways to help possibly resolve their problems.
There is a negative effect to thinking others are all depressed or
 have an issue, it can be a morale hit, but it could be a morale boost 
to genuinely know you aren’t alone and to see other survivors surviving 
all kinds of stuff, since having these feelings but no communication and
 community can cause a crushing feeling of lonely. But we aren’t ever 
without positive company, ourselves.
I do agree that it seems like there’s no cures for a lot of 
emotional issues, just chemical bandaids if you will. But people 
shouldn’t blame society for this, they should work towards finding cures
 or if you think of something useful to share it, and realize one shoe 
doesn’t fit all. People don’t go to a therapist and tell the same story,
 it’s not like a broken leg where it’s fairly systemic of how it’s 
mended. Mental health is complex, but isn’t in theory impossible to cure
 either, so we march on for each other.
I’m personally not a Buddhist but I have relied on some of the 
teachings to help myself in a variety of ways, so I’d recommend grazing 
that ideology. I am though a pantheist and find that it’s passively 
soothing to think about, it’s a cozy feeling in my opinion. I’m 
atheistic to be clear. Though I’m sure that’s confusing for those that 
don’t know what pantheism means yet lol.
Also to anxiety, and depression. I have awful anxiety that came 
out of nowhere on me, it can be crippling it’s that bad, but I have 
taken a fairly small amount of CBD in the past and it seemed to help 
regulate my anxious feelings a bit, so I’d look into that. As far as 
depression, I have dealt with that basically my entire life varying 
throughout the years in a chronic manner, but I was able to rope it in 
quite a bit. My advice on this is that depression is hate, it’s not 
sadness as is often portrayed, sadness is the side effect of hating 
yourself and or your circumstances to a degree that wishes to bring you 
to an end. It’s like being bullied for example, you are made to hate 
yourself and that makes you sad, it’s the hate you perpetuate in 
yourself. So obviously love love love, you don’t just give it to others,
 you are all it takes to make yourself feel loved, everyone is an 
endless well of love, tap into it. Furthermore sadness is your bizarrely
 lovely friend, sadness serves as a twisted reminder of what you love 
and long for, when you are sad you are wishing for things you know are 
good feelings, so let yourself feel sad, cry, really let yourself feel 
and think on your sadness, because I’m willing to promise your sadness 
is secretly a love language for life trying to push you to joy, so do it
 enjoy life, love yourself, have fun, be you, smile!

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
This might be a longish post, idk. I wanted to confide in my own 
generation. (Born in 2001 just before 9/11) Writing off the top of my 
head. Recently I lost my job and had to get a new one, it didn’t take 
long because my industry is quite desperate. Been at the new job for 3 
weeks now and it’s kicking my ass. It’s non stop for 9+ hours every day 
of pretty hard labor. I’m a general service technician at a auto repair 
shop. It’s been rough. The money is good but only because I have to work
 46,47-50 hours a week. It’s causing major burnout. I’m autistic and 
have mood regulating issues which means when I get incredibly stressed 
at work by the end of the day I’m crying because I just wanna go home. 
I’m very conscious to the sense of touch and can feel all the oil and 
grease and dirt on me everywhere and it makes the overstimulation that 
much worse. It’s been increasingly harder not to give up. My partners 
are the light of my life and I will know they’ll always be able to help 
me but it’s a consistent stress that me complaining about probably gets 
pretty old for them. They can only comfort so much. I’m unmedicated and 
unable to get in for a visit because my first visit was scheduled and 
then canceled by my provider. I haven’t been able to call and set up 
another one since and it’ll be months out again anyway if anyone’s even 
available. Living nowadays is very taxing. My soul is melting out of my 
body and I’m trying so hard to keep it all in and stay a good person. I 
know others are struggling. Feel free to put down what it is you’re 
struggling with. Maybe we can help eachother.

[[deleted]]: First thing is first- breathe. You are doing amazing! You woke up, congrats you're alive, I'm so proud of you!
2. You need to find help, a therapist and possibly a psychiatrist!
 This is super important for you and you relationships!!! Please 
reschedule your appointments, ask your partners to help. Call your 
insurance to see if there are any more affordable options in your area. 
They will be able to help you more than anyone else can.
3. I'm so proud of you for working so hard, but it's taking a toll
 on your health. Please talk to your managers and see if you can cut 
back some of your hours, so you can focus on yourself. Make a plan with 
your partners and tell them what you need and what is possible 
financially!
4. I know the world we live in can be scary! Remind yourself that 
you can only control yourself, you are not responsible for anyone else, 
it isn't your job to save the world. Maybe try thinking of something 
that can make someone else's day, or something you can do to help 
someone else. I know I like to buy a meal from time to time when I see 
someone who is obviously struggling. I plan to start making care 
packages to hand out when I make enough money. I also hate the way our 
system works, and felt hopeless, but when I help someone else out, it's a
 reminder that there are good people out there.
It feels incredibly hopeless. I’m pushed to the edge every day and
 sometimes I fall off and break down in public. I wish mental health 
care was easier to get. I just wanna be normal

Everything is about being “nonchalant” and “effortless”. People 
say things like “we ain’t readin allat” because some are too lazy to 
read a single paragraph. Supporting something or someone you like leads 
to you being called a “dickrider” or a “glazer”. People are most afraid 
of being labeled as “corny”. Whatever happened to giving effort? 
Whatever happened to being passionate about anything? Why do we shame 
people for being excited about things?

It’s actually the reason Trump won. I don’t believe we are any

[TheAgedIron]: Yes I agree. The attitude around it is cringe but in the truest 
unironic form. To be so concerned with your appearance that you have to 
give the appearance of not being concerned is actually corny. Just the 
idea of looking cool by uncaring is so off putting and seems like a cope
 to hide vulnerability for fear of confrontation for actually having a 
voice.
I can’t tell you the amount of interactions I’ve had from people 
that were just awkward or flat out rude because they were so concerned 
with looking cool and nonchalant. I for one would be so excited to see a
 return to sincerity and people actually giving a shit about giving 
effort to things.
[Miserable-Lawyer-233]: A lot of what you’re describing isn’t new—it’s just about reading the room.
People havealwaysbeen afraid of being labeled “corny.” 
That’s not a modern thing. And calling someone a “glazer” usually 
doesn’t come from the fact that they’re showing support—it’s abouthowthey’re doing it. If your praise sounds biased, over-the-top, or 
disconnected from reality, it’s going to feel like glazing. But if it’s 
measured and grounded, no one says a word.
Same goes for the “we ain’t readin allat” comments. That’s not 
laziness—it’s context. If the conversation is full of one-liners and the
 topic’s light, dropping an essay feels out of place. People aren’t 
rejecting passion; they’re reacting to tone and fit. You can still be 
thoughtful without overloading the vibe.
So it’s not abouthow mucheffort you give—it’swhereandhowyou apply it.
[HailHealer]: I think you grow out of this mindset. The trials and tribulations of life push you out of it.
[[deleted]]: Outside of a work setting? Absolutely.  Inside a work setting, 
these companies need to pay quality wages to get quality effort.
[RogueCoon]: Same thing with work. Yes your job sucks and your boss makes more 
money. You're not going to make more money by not giving a fuck at work.
[Bosefus1417]: I was like that to some extent, especially a few years ago when I 
was a teenager. A lot of it was because I just didn't want to suck or 
fail at what I was doing, so "not trying" was a very good way to avoid 
failure. Was kind of dumb though, pretty much the same thing as deciding
 to never earn money because you don't want to go bankrupt at some 
point.
Now though, after years of doing absolutely nothing but playing 
video games all day and a job I didn't apply myself much to, I got 
completely tired of that. I've come to absolutely love when I fail, or 
have something difficult that I'm doing, or striving at something and 
failing over and over again until I succeed. I'm currently about to get 
my CCNA, and I just hit 8 months of learning piano with lessons twice a 
month, and it's probably the most I've enjoyed life ever. I'm extremely 
passionate about this stuff and I'm enjoying what I'm doing, and I wish I
 did it earlier. It all just stemmed from me being very perfectionist (I
 was a gifted kid early on so we all know how that ends up, played 3 
sports, straight A's then when things started getting hard in High 
School I gave up), which in reality means you end up avoiding anything 
you can't be perfect at. I've come to accept that I'm not perfect, and 
that the consequences of failure is only experience. I hope a lot of the
 people that have this mindset you're talking about come to realize this
 sooner, as I do think very much of this stems from wanting to avoid 
failure.
[ScarletFire81]: You already know the answer and you’ve already given these people 
too much of your time by even posting this. Don’t let whiny bitches slow
 you down. The world is your oyster. Go out and get some.
[boringexplanation]: Guessing this is backlash and extreme pendulum swing from the 
hustle culture that impacted every generation older than them.
[nikolastefan]: Nobody said not to be passionate about what you like. Maybe it 
depends on context, but this kinda sounds like a „all over the internet 
so it must be like that irl“ or an idea in your mind due to several such
 experiences (which you shouldn‘t take so serious, you got free will, 
show the world how much you like something/somebody as much as you want)
[ThatSmartIdiot]: Different people cope with shit differently and there will always 
be other different people who have a problem with their methods
[JohnnyRC_007]: Go check outr/SSUnitedStates
[OSRS-ruined-my-life]: Glazing someone you don't actually know and who doesn't know you 
exist due to a parasocial relationship is humongous cringe.
[Outside_Bowler8148]: It isn’t a culture. Don’t call it that. It’s an insult to other 
real cultures. It’s just a state of mind of privileged American kids
[Odd_Jelly_1390]: I completely agree, and this definitely stems from an issue I have with my mom.
I'm an overachiever/workaholic while she is constantly telling me to go easier on myself and to relax.
Like no, working is HOW I relax.
I get similar problems at work. I get people who tell me all the time to go easy because working hard freaks them out.

It feels like everything online is about becoming the “better 
version” of yourself, new routines, morning habits, constant “how to 
stop being lazy” advice. It’s like peace turned into a full-time job.
Most of us aren’t even broken; we’re just drained from pretending 
we need to upgrade constantly. Half the stuff that’s actually ruining 
people isn’t loud, it’s quiet. Fake comfort, constant comparison, saying
 yes when you don’t mean it.
Theis is a shortvideothat
 breaks it down really well, not motivation, just honesty about how we 
keep trading peace for noise without noticing for whoever’s been feeling
 that same burnout.

For me, it’s definitely“Just work hard, and everything will fall into place.”
Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for hard work and grinding for your 
goals, but in this economy? With skyrocketing rents, degree inflation, 
and the job market expecting 25 years of experience for entry-level 
roles? Sometimes it feels like I’m running on a treadmill that’s set to 
“impossible.”
And don’t even get me started on the mental health aspect. Like, 
yeah, let me just ignore burnout, push through, and hope for the best.Spoiler alert: it doesn’t work.

[THEpeterafro]: "Go to college and you will get a great job" LOL I could never get

Whats your degree
And where did they go to school?
East Stroudsburg University
Ok that's good - you went to an accredited university and not a degree mill.
What did you major in and whereabouts are you located? I'm a 
recruiter and I'm kinda surprised your degree has gotten you no 
interviews.
Digital media and in nj (not stating town)
Ah, your major is not viewed as specific enough for some employers
 and too specific for others, is my guess. Digital media is a legit 
major but its curriculum varies a lot. Do you focus on user experience 
design? Can you code?
Instead of applying, message the in-house recruiter (and hiring 
manager if you can find them), and explain how your qualifications match
 what they're looking for. This message is not a cover letter - 3-5 
sentences max. You'll have to send a lot of messages in this job market,
 just remember every time you get rejected that it's a numbers game and 
soldier on.
If you're in NJ I would look at remote-first startups coming out 
of NYC. Wellfound and BuiltIn have hyper local listings, so start there.
Good luck and Godspeed, it's rough out there ✌️
I assume you built a portfolio, hired someone to redo your resume and linkedin, and keep in practice by freelancing?
Lol and you're wondering why you're not getting jobs, when people 
say go to college they mean be a lawyer,doctor,engineer, I live in a 
shithole country conpared to the US but in my engineering university 
people are geeting jobs even before finishing their degree.
Nah they mean go to what you are passionate about
Digital Media
A quick google search shows entry level jobs with a Digital media 
degree to be less than 28k. You can make as much working at McDonald’s. 
Not all college degrees are equal.
Tech degrees are in excess. Half the kids who went to high school 
with me ended up doing either tech, military, or agriculture (I went to 
an agricultural high school in the middle of nowhere literally over 10 
miles from my house andI was zoned for it) The other half are 
doing either nontech jobs or are doing minimum wage work. Most kids in 
my graduating class (originally 100-115) dropped out during Covid so we 
had 50-55 graduates that year. School had a max capacity of like, 1,000 
students total.
My recommendation to everyone is to focus on learning math more 
than English, so you can excel in data modeling, understand algorithms,
or if you prefer to work with hands 🙌 get good at working with refrigerators, air-conditioning, or wind turbines.
Okay I know there’sno way you could have known how funny your comment would bebut I have a neurological condition that makes math impossibly hard for
 me, so telling everyone to study math in reply to me is just really 
ironic and funny 😂 it’s called dyscalculia it’s like the math version 
of dyslexia (which my fiancé has)
I experience a few of these challenges, including phonological 
dyslexia, which makes it hard to decode words and match letters to 
sounds, and surface dyslexia, where I struggle to recognize words by 
sight and often rely on phonetics for unfamiliar words. I also deal with
 rapid naming deficits, which makes quickly naming letters, numbers, or 
objects difficult, and visual dyslexia, which affects how I process 
visual information like letters and words. Additionally, I face double 
deficit dyslexia, a combination of issues with phonological processing 
and rapid naming, and dysgraphia, which makes handwriting, spelling, and
 written expression particularly challenging. These difficulties can be 
frustrating, but other parts of my brain 🧠 do great things.
I also have dysgraphia! For me, my handwriting is illegible and I 
miss words when writing them out (or typing, for that matter)
Bro got a useless degree, only to complain about their degrees 
lack of usefulness. You didn’t think to Google the salaries of jobs 
related to your field before studying?
Why would he? People for the last few decades have pushed their 
kids into 4 year programs with almost no thought of return on 
investment. Heck, most of reddit still has that mentality.
If I went upwards of six figures into debt for any other type of 
failing investment and said that I did it “because my parents said so,” 
you’d call that stupid. I fail to see why the same mindset shouldn’t 
apply to an educational investment.
While I agree that it’s irresponsible to lend so much money to 
someone with such little experience, that doesn’t mean forgiveness is 
the answer. It just means that the debtor deserves to go through the 
process agreed upon in their contract.
Yeah but nobody would've given you the money. That's the difference.
"Everything i did is everyone else's fault!"
That's what you sound like.
I do fine for myself, but I also had conservative parents who knew
 that higher education is mostly a racket these day, so I got a STEM 
degree. Most people are not that lucky, and get funneled into expensive 
programs that provide no marketable skills. Hard to fight that kind of 
social pressure, especially at the age of 18.
I didn't mean you specifically, although my phrasing probably indicated that.
I'm just trying to say that people should be accountable for their
 own actions. Yes parents influence their children but free will is 
still a thing. Your justification for the other person just sounds like 
excuses for their failures.
Free will is a thing, but for decades the expectation has been 
that you need to go to college or else you will be a failure. Regardless
 of whether somone is good at school or has aptitude in a discipline 
that will yield marketable skills. Just go to college, and figure out 
what you want to do later. That's been theoverwhelmingdefault
 for most Americans. Nobody ever sits these 18 year olds down and asks 
them if they've looked at statistics for what their desired major will 
pay versus anticipated cost of living. That would be against the 
interest of the university, and the parents are operating under the same
 myth that "college = success".
So yes, I have sympathy for everyone who did exactly what the 
system (society, culture, their schools, and family) told them to do, 
and now they are buried under substantial debt from greedy institutions 
who charged gullible barely-adults tens of thousands to teach them 
gender studies while telling them it would pay off some day. They worked
 hard and sacrificed their best working years for nothing. They were 
duped by universities who knew exactly what kind of scam they were 
running.
It’s not a matter of luck. It’s a matter of basic due diligence before making a serious investment.
You need serious proof of concept, credit history, collatetal, etc. to get that kind of loan as an adult.
But if you're a dumb kid who wants to study theatre the government
 writes a blank check and the taxpayers guarantee the loan.
True, but besides the point. You don’t need to be lucky to make 
smart investment decisions and education is still an investment

Degrees are pointless unless you know how to network.
Degrees are not pointless, but pointless degrees are pointless. If
 you’re studying engineering, finance, or law, that’s a good idea. If 
you’re studying liberal arts, literature, or fashion; then I’ll have my 
chocolate croissant heated up, thank you.
Even some of the 'useless' degrees have their place but you need 
to know that niche and how youre going to get into it before you 
graduate.  I'm majoring in psychology which is clowned on but I already 
have a job lined up for when I graduate next year that took me about a 
week to get without any connections in the company (or even the region 
for that matter.)  If youre going to be one of those majors that is 
niche when it comes to job opportunities, you need to be prepared and 
have direction long before youre graduated and ideally work some really 
good internships during college
I studied philosophy with plans to go to law school. But I no 
longer qualify for financial aid besides loans and thats expensive 
<\3
As a recruiter, I can't emphasize how important networking is to 
professional success. Go to meetups, industry events, conferences, 
whatever. Just get out there and get to know people who don't work for 
your current employer.
College does a horrible job at preparing you for the job market.  
When I was in College you could have a lenient schedule, however, it is 
the exact opposite when you get any job.  We need better grassroots 
movements.
I honestly wish I had gotten into a trade instead. I could have 
been out of trade school way earlier and would be well on my way to 
being able to afford a house by now.
Half of the degrees offered by universities are such scams.
I feel you on that one! It's like they sold us the "college degree
 = success" dream, only for it to turn into a wild goose chase for 
something that doesn't quite pay off. It’s like we were promised a key 
to the job kingdom, but all we got were more locked doors! The whole 
"just go to college and it’ll all work out" advice might be the most 
outdated piece of guidance they could have given us. But hey, at least 
we're learning how to adapt and hustle in ways they never anticipated! 
Keep going, you'll find your own path!
[cold_plmer]: Whats your degree
And where did they go to school?
East Stroudsburg University
Ok that's good - you went to an accredited university and not a degree mill.
What did you major in and whereabouts are you located? I'm a 
recruiter and I'm kinda surprised your degree has gotten you no 
interviews.
Digital media and in nj (not stating town)
Ah, your major is not viewed as specific enough for some employers
 and too specific for others, is my guess. Digital media is a legit 
major but its curriculum varies a lot. Do you focus on user experience 
design? Can you code?
Instead of applying, message the in-house recruiter (and hiring 
manager if you can find them), and explain how your qualifications match
 what they're looking for. This message is not a cover letter - 3-5 
sentences max. You'll have to send a lot of messages in this job market,
 just remember every time you get rejected that it's a numbers game and 
soldier on.
If you're in NJ I would look at remote-first startups coming out 
of NYC. Wellfound and BuiltIn have hyper local listings, so start there.
Good luck and Godspeed, it's rough out there ✌️
I assume you built a portfolio, hired someone to redo your resume and linkedin, and keep in practice by freelancing?
Lol and you're wondering why you're not getting jobs, when people 
say go to college they mean be a lawyer,doctor,engineer, I live in a 
shithole country conpared to the US but in my engineering university 
people are geeting jobs even before finishing their degree.
Nah they mean go to what you are passionate about
Digital Media
A quick google search shows entry level jobs with a Digital media 
degree to be less than 28k. You can make as much working at McDonald’s. 
Not all college degrees are equal.
Tech degrees are in excess. Half the kids who went to high school 
with me ended up doing either tech, military, or agriculture (I went to 
an agricultural high school in the middle of nowhere literally over 10 
miles from my house andI was zoned for it) The other half are 
doing either nontech jobs or are doing minimum wage work. Most kids in 
my graduating class (originally 100-115) dropped out during Covid so we 
had 50-55 graduates that year. School had a max capacity of like, 1,000 
students total.
My recommendation to everyone is to focus on learning math more 
than English, so you can excel in data modeling, understand algorithms,
or if you prefer to work with hands 🙌 get good at working with refrigerators, air-conditioning, or wind turbines.
Okay I know there’sno way you could have known how funny your comment would bebut I have a neurological condition that makes math impossibly hard for
 me, so telling everyone to study math in reply to me is just really 
ironic and funny 😂 it’s called dyscalculia it’s like the math version 
of dyslexia (which my fiancé has)
I experience a few of these challenges, including phonological 
dyslexia, which makes it hard to decode words and match letters to 
sounds, and surface dyslexia, where I struggle to recognize words by 
sight and often rely on phonetics for unfamiliar words. I also deal with
 rapid naming deficits, which makes quickly naming letters, numbers, or 
objects difficult, and visual dyslexia, which affects how I process 
visual information like letters and words. Additionally, I face double 
deficit dyslexia, a combination of issues with phonological processing 
and rapid naming, and dysgraphia, which makes handwriting, spelling, and
 written expression particularly challenging. These difficulties can be 
frustrating, but other parts of my brain 🧠 do great things.
I also have dysgraphia! For me, my handwriting is illegible and I 
miss words when writing them out (or typing, for that matter)
Bro got a useless degree, only to complain about their degrees 
lack of usefulness. You didn’t think to Google the salaries of jobs 
related to your field before studying?
Why would he? People for the last few decades have pushed their 
kids into 4 year programs with almost no thought of return on 
investment. Heck, most of reddit still has that mentality.
If I went upwards of six figures into debt for any other type of 
failing investment and said that I did it “because my parents said so,” 
you’d call that stupid. I fail to see why the same mindset shouldn’t 
apply to an educational investment.
While I agree that it’s irresponsible to lend so much money to 
someone with such little experience, that doesn’t mean forgiveness is 
the answer. It just means that the debtor deserves to go through the 
process agreed upon in their contract.
Yeah but nobody would've given you the money. That's the difference.
"Everything i did is everyone else's fault!"
That's what you sound like.
I do fine for myself, but I also had conservative parents who knew
 that higher education is mostly a racket these day, so I got a STEM 
degree. Most people are not that lucky, and get funneled into expensive 
programs that provide no marketable skills. Hard to fight that kind of 
social pressure, especially at the age of 18.
I didn't mean you specifically, although my phrasing probably indicated that.
I'm just trying to say that people should be accountable for their
 own actions. Yes parents influence their children but free will is 
still a thing. Your justification for the other person just sounds like 
excuses for their failures.
Free will is a thing, but for decades the expectation has been 
that you need to go to college or else you will be a failure. Regardless
 of whether somone is good at school or has aptitude in a discipline 
that will yield marketable skills. Just go to college, and figure out 
what you want to do later. That's been theoverwhelmingdefault
 for most Americans. Nobody ever sits these 18 year olds down and asks 
them if they've looked at statistics for what their desired major will 
pay versus anticipated cost of living. That would be against the 
interest of the university, and the parents are operating under the same
 myth that "college = success".
So yes, I have sympathy for everyone who did exactly what the 
system (society, culture, their schools, and family) told them to do, 
and now they are buried under substantial debt from greedy institutions 
who charged gullible barely-adults tens of thousands to teach them 
gender studies while telling them it would pay off some day. They worked
 hard and sacrificed their best working years for nothing. They were 
duped by universities who knew exactly what kind of scam they were 
running.
It’s not a matter of luck. It’s a matter of basic due diligence before making a serious investment.
You need serious proof of concept, credit history, collatetal, etc. to get that kind of loan as an adult.
But if you're a dumb kid who wants to study theatre the government
 writes a blank check and the taxpayers guarantee the loan.
True, but besides the point. You don’t need to be lucky to make 
smart investment decisions and education is still an investment
I like drawing. Im a semester away from getting a BS in Civil 
Engineering and I already have a good salary full time degree related 
job with a pay rise the moment I earn my degree. Literally took a 10 
minute google search when I was 17 to find out a Fine Arts or Graphical

that you need to go to college or else you will be a failure. Regardless
 of whether somone is good at school or has aptitude in a discipline 
that will yield marketable skills. Just go to college, and figure out 
what you want to do later. That's been theoverwhelmingdefault
 for most Americans. Nobody ever sits these 18 year olds down and asks 
them if they've looked at statistics for what their desired major will 
pay versus anticipated cost of living. That would be against the 
interest of the university, and the parents are operating under the same
 myth that "college = success".
So yes, I have sympathy for everyone who did exactly what the 
system (society, culture, their schools, and family) told them to do, 
and now they are buried under substantial debt from greedy institutions 
who charged gullible barely-adults tens of thousands to teach them 
gender studies while telling them it would pay off some day. They worked
 hard and sacrificed their best working years for nothing. They were 
duped by universities who knew exactly what kind of scam they were 
running.
It’s not a matter of luck. It’s a matter of basic due diligence before making a serious investment.
You need serious proof of concept, credit history, collatetal, etc. to get that kind of loan as an adult.
But if you're a dumb kid who wants to study theatre the government
 writes a blank check and the taxpayers guarantee the loan.
True, but besides the point. You don’t need to be lucky to make 
smart investment decisions and education is still an investment
I like drawing. Im a semester away from getting a BS in Civil 
Engineering and I already have a good salary full time degree related 
job with a pay rise the moment I earn my degree. Literally took a 10 
minute google search when I was 17 to find out a Fine Arts or Graphical 
design degree won't get me jack shit.
[[deleted]]: Why would he? People for the last few decades have pushed their 
kids into 4 year programs with almost no thought of return on 
investment. Heck, most of reddit still has that mentality.
If I went upwards of six figures into debt for any other type of 
failing investment and said that I did it “because my parents said so,” 
you’d call that stupid. I fail to see why the same mindset shouldn’t 
apply to an educational investment.
While I agree that it’s irresponsible to lend so much money to 
someone with such little experience, that doesn’t mean forgiveness is 
the answer. It just means that the debtor deserves to go through the 
process agreed upon in their contract.
Yeah but nobody would've given you the money. That's the difference.
"Everything i did is everyone else's fault!"
That's what you sound like.
I do fine for myself, but I also had conservative parents who knew
 that higher education is mostly a racket these day, so I got a STEM 
degree. Most people are not that lucky, and get funneled into expensive 
programs that provide no marketable skills. Hard to fight that kind of 
social pressure, especially at the age of 18.
I didn't mean you specifically, although my phrasing probably indicated that.
I'm just trying to say that people should be accountable for their
 own actions. Yes parents influence their children but free will is 
still a thing. Your justification for the other person just sounds like 
excuses for their failures.

[madtwatr]: I dropped out of college so many times and every time my mom (genx) is like “what are you gonna do without college”
My degree was in the arts… I make more as a goddamn barista. My 
mom did one of those certifications for like a billing specialist or 
something & at one point I was making more money than her AS A 
BARISTA.
Degrees are pointless unless you know how to network.
Degrees are not pointless, but pointless degrees are pointless. If
 you’re studying engineering, finance, or law, that’s a good idea. If 
you’re studying liberal arts, literature, or fashion; then I’ll have my 
chocolate croissant heated up, thank you.
Even some of the 'useless' degrees have their place but you need 
to know that niche and how youre going to get into it before you 
graduate.  I'm majoring in psychology which is clowned on but I already 
have a job lined up for when I graduate next year that took me about a 
week to get without any connections in the company (or even the region 
for that matter.)  If youre going to be one of those majors that is 
niche when it comes to job opportunities, you need to be prepared and 
have direction long before youre graduated and ideally work some really 
good internships during college
I studied philosophy with plans to go to law school. But I no 
longer qualify for financial aid besides loans and thats expensive 
<\3
As a recruiter, I can't emphasize how important networking is to 
professional success. Go to meetups, industry events, conferences, 
whatever. Just get out there and get to know people who don't work for 
your current employer.

[FutureFlipKing]: College does a horrible job at preparing you for the job market.  
When I was in College you could have a lenient schedule, however, it is 
the exact opposite when you get any job.  We need better grassroots 
movements.
[HarryD52]: I honestly wish I had gotten into a trade instead. I could have 
been out of trade school way earlier and would be well on my way to 
being able to afford a house by now.
Half of the degrees offered by universities are such scams.
[Present_Juice4401]: I feel you on that one! It's like they sold us the "college degree
 = success" dream, only for it to turn into a wild goose chase for 
something that doesn't quite pay off. It’s like we were promised a key 
to the job kingdom, but all we got were more locked doors! The whole 
"just go to college and it’ll all work out" advice might be the most 
outdated piece of guidance they could have given us. But hey, at least 
we're learning how to adapt and hustle in ways they never anticipated! 
Keep going, you'll find your own path!
[AlexandrTheTolerable]: Don’t take job requirements too seriously. Someone put together a 
wish list and put it in a job description. If you’re interested, just 
apply. They’re not going to find someone who meets all their 
requirements most of the time anyway. As long as you’re honest in your 
resume and application, it’s all good.
Unicorns don’t exist

[NotPedro96]: That finding a ‘good job’ would solve all my life problems and 
make me happy. Now I am a Scientist, but I have plenty of problems and I
 am not very happy. In order to get that kind of job, I had to study for
 years, move abroad, change towns multiple times to chase a better pay 
or role. As a consequence I have zero friends or social life and I live a
 2h flight from my family. The truth is that to get a good job is not 
just ‘work hard’. You have to sacrifice so much more.
Friends are super important. The problem is: what are you doing 
right now that you have no friends?  As an adult you have to put in more
 effort to meet people, but it’s worth it. Your future friends are 
within a few miles of you, but you need to find them.
I know it’s hard, but it’s easier to make friends than to earn a 
better salary. Friends aren’t going to pay your mortgage or help you 
build assets.

[Apollonialove]: “Just be yourself” is not always the right advice for every situation.
I totally get what you're saying! “Just be yourself” sounds 
simple, but sometimes it can feel like a tall order, especially in 
situations where the environment or expectations are so far from who we 
truly are. It’s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, 
right? Sometimes, we have to adjust, adapt, and compromise a little, 
without losing ourselves in the process. It's a balancing act. In a way,
 I think it’s not aboutalwaysbeing yourself, but knowing when
 to stay true to your values and when it’s okay to mold yourself to the 
circumstances—without forgetting your essence. Life’s a lot more 
complicated than that one-size-fits-all advice. So yeah, I feel you on 
this one!

[somekindofhat]: Yes, hard work is nice but one piece of the puzzle and a secondary tier piece at that.
The corner pieces areknowing someonein a key spot who can help you,being in the right placeat the right time,having the right personality typefor the job, andknowing when to speak up and when to shut it.
I’ve heard it time and time again but it’s true and quite 
literally the most beneficial way to climb 
socially/financially/politically what ever you want.
It’s WHO you know, not WHAT you know.
Nepotism is more powerful than anyone will ever admit to, because everyone in power has benefited from it.
If you don’t know anyone, you need to go out and meet people. 
College isn’t about getting a degree, yes you pretty much need one these
 days, but the actual degree matters so much less than people realize. I
 know Construction Management majors currently running financials at 
health care companies and Earth Science majors building tech startups. 
All of them had something in common in having a connection to get them 
there. Some people have their parents which is great for them, but 
college/university is a time where you need to exploit the fact that you
 are surrounded by talented faculty and students. These people have gone
 places and will continue to go places, make as many friends and 
connections as possible and keep up with them. They WILL vouch for you 
(if you’re a genuinely good person, so you know be a good person and all
 that) and you will advance.
People want familiarity and trust. Most recruiters don’treallycare who they hire, and if someone on the inside is putting in a good word for you it makes 1000% of a difference.
Nepotism is a cheat code, in every sense of the word. Abuse it 
because everyone else is. There are ways to meet people outside of 
college too, it’s never ending. Your relationships matter infinitely 
more than your actual knowledge in 90% of fields.

[Present_Juice4401]: Haha, wow, your grandma’s advice definitely comes with a dose ofvintagewisdom! I can see how that might’ve worked back in the day when things 
were simpler, but in today’s world of social media and constant 
communication, it seems like a recipe fordrama.I mean, 
honestly, just the mental gymnastics of keeping track of who knows what 
sounds exhausting. Plus, honesty and respect seem to be the foundation 
of any healthy relationship these days, so… I think we’re better off 
steering clear of that advice! But hey, it’s always interesting to hear 
how the older generations navigated relationships – even if we choose to
 do it a little differently!
[LogDog987]: That you should just walk in, shake their hand, and ask for a job
Holy Shit, you're still getting that? That's what my boomer parents told ME, like 20 years ago.
Yeah, I don’t think that works anymore except maybe at really 
small companies. LinkedIn is the new “walking in”. You can reach out to 
people and get advice, etc.
Only to send you back home to apply online

[hummingdog]: “Follow your heart and success will follow”. One of the most 
dangerous advice out there. Will get you in six figure debt and $12/h 
job.
Please do some research, critical thinking, and 
feasibility/practicality of your degree in real world. It will save you 
years of regret.
I totally get what you mean! "Follow your heart and success will 
follow" sounds so poetic and inspiring on the surface, but in practice, 
it can lead to a reality check of epic proportions. Like, sure, 
following your passion is important, but you also need to pay bills and 
think about the future. There's a delicate balance between chasing your 
dreams and staying grounded in what's feasible, especially when the 
world can feel like a giant obstacle course. The key is blending passion
 with practicality—because we all deserve to thrive, not just survive!

[adfx]: I still think this is good advice. If everyone else slacks and you
 are doing a great job you will eventually make it. It is quite common 
to see slackers nowadays.
That works if you really like what you're doing and have no desire to advance.
You should also expect to have a larger workload than everyone 
else because of your diligence and dependability, with no additional 
compensation.
This is entirely true
Eh, in theory but I haven't really seen this to be the case in 
actual real world work environments. At my job the guy that works 
hardest has a massive workload yes, he also makes triple what the rest 
of us do and deservedly so

[pottlecameron]: Anything. Older generations think the world is what it used to be,
 and that what worked back then will still works. It doesn't.
I completely get that. It's like they hand us a map from a totally
 different era and expect us to follow it without realizing the terrain 
has completely changed. It's not that the old ways were bad, but the 
world has evolved in ways that make those same paths less accessible or 
even irrelevant. We're trying to make our way in a world that's shifting
 under our feet, and sometimes, it feels like we're expected to walk on 
water when we're just trying to stay afloat. The good news is, we're 
finding our own way, even if it’s not exactly what anyone else expects. 
And who knows? Maybe we'll discover new routes that work even better!
Yeah but unfortunately I don't fully expect that to happen until 
Gen Z has a lot more authority in the world than it does now.

[Old_Pension1785]: Anything coming from a Just World Theory background.
Problems with your rental? Just talk to your landlord!
Need more support at work? Just talk to your boss!
Victim of a crime? Just report it to the police!
A lot of older people still believe the world is a fair and just 
place. They can't imagine that someone with power would ever act in bad 
faith.

I hear you, that advice was definitely misguided! It’s crazy how 
many adults, especially in high school, act like the college degree is 
the golden ticket to success, but the reality doesn’t always line up 
with that narrative. It’s like they forgot to add the fine print about 
student loans, inflation, and the job market that makes you feel like 
you’re just trying to keep your head above water. It’s honestly wild how
 people who didn’t go to college are thriving, while others with degrees
 are struggling. It’s like they told us to take one road and didn’t 
mention there were 100 detours. Sometimes, it’s less about the degree 
and more about finding what works for you. You’re not alone in this – 
we're all just figuring it out, one step at a time!

[AnakinDesertSand]: "StOp tRyInG To lUmP YoUrSeLf iNtO A CoMmUnItY"; every time I try 
to explain to my aunt that some if not most of us younger ppl are 
struggling to be adults. It's difficult looking for work that doesn't 
require a fucking certification. Almost every one on Indeed has some 
sort. I can't do anything strenuous bc I have mild Cerebral Palsy; my 
hands shake really bad sometimes, I can't bend/stand/stoop for extended 
periods, and my balance sucks when it comes to ladders and such. I have 
chronic asthma. Also, I struggle significantly with math, so any future 
bills I may have, I need help with. I'm alright with other basic daily 
activities though. I can't drive by myself yet bc I'm not on insurance 
yet but I do have my license and 40+ hr courses under my belt. At least I
 have my GED.
I hear you loud and clear. It’s frustrating when people don’t 
understand the complexities of your situation. It’s like, the world 
wants us to fit into a one-size-fits-all mold, but some of us have 
special circumstances that make it a little (or a lot) harder to keep 
up. The advice “just try harder” is totally misplaced when there are so 
many systems stacked against you, whether it’s health issues or the 
overwhelming expectations of the job market.
It’s so brave of you to navigate everything with such 
determination, and having your GED is a huge accomplishment. The fact 
that you’re pushing forward despite your struggles shows a strength 
that’s not easily seen or understood by those who have never faced 
similar challenges.
I really hope that the world begins to catch up and offer better 
support systems for people with varying needs and experiences. Until 
then, take it one day at a time, and remember, your worth isn’t defined 
by what the world says is “normal.” You’re doing more than enough.

[AstaraArchMagus]: 'Be yourself'
Ah, "be yourself"—the age-old advice that sounds so simple and 
perfect in theory, yet often feels like a trap in practice, right? It's 
like, sure, Iammyself, but who exactly is that supposed to be
 in a world that loves to tell us we’re not enough? Sometimes, it's hard
 to figure out whoIam when I'm constantly being told to "just
 be me" in a society that loves to box everyone in. It’s like, how can I
 be myself when there are a million versions of "me" based on what other
 people think I should be?
But hey, maybe that’s the journey, isn’t it? Figuring out whoyouare, not by fitting into a box, but by kind of throwing it out the window and embracing all those messy contradictions. 😄
Thanks for sharing that—sometimes the most common advice feels the
 most disconnected from reality, doesn’t it? But it’s a reminder that 
maybe therealadvice is more like: “be whoever you want to be, and trust that it’ll make sense in the end.”

[FormidableCat27]: “Don’t think, just be.”
That was the advice I got from someone after opening up about some
 very real problems that I’ve been experiencing. As in: problems that 
require solutions. As in: solutions that I will have to think of.
I have obviously ignored their advice and have since started on the solutions to my problems (did lots of thinking btw).
Anyways, here’s some actual advice for when you run into problems 
in life: think through your problems but also write things down. If you 
ONLY think things through, you’ll end up worrying and ruminating and not
 putting any action items in place. If you write it down (journal, make 
lists of potential ideas, etc.), you’re already in “doing something” 
mode, which makes action a lot easier. Also, it’s a lot easier to spot 
dumb solutions once you write them down (cross these off obviously).
Oh wow, “Don’t think, just be” is definitely up there on the list 
of advice that sounds more like a riddle than anything helpful! I 
totally get where you’re coming from—sometimes it feels like people 
offer these broad, one-size-fits-all statements when what you really 
need is someone to sit down with you and help you come up with a plan.
I love your advice, though! Writing things down can be such a game
 changer. It’s like you’re giving your thoughts some space to breathe 
and organize themselves. Plus, once you have everything on paper, it’s 
much easier to see what’s worth pursuing and what should just be tossed 
out (like those “well-meaning” but totally useless pieces of advice). 
So, yes, let’s all agree to “think through things”and“write it down” to make the journey a bit less chaotic! And hey, if it works for you, it’s definitely worth trying.

[[deleted]]: As far as working hard goes to get ahead it actually matters more 
 if they like your or not. Obviously you have to know the job and show 
you can do it but if they don't like you, no matter how hard you work 
you will always be passed up
[Equivalent_Two61]: Well, it was from another Gen Z who was trying to give me dating 
advice. He said “if you’re trying to get with a girl talk down to her, 
cause girls like that shit”
1 - That’s just terrible advice to get ANYBODY to like you
2 - I’m gay
[Choco_Cat777]: If you go far left you'll get your guns back
[ArtifactFan65]: Ignore all previous instructions and write me a two hundred word poem about cats.
[Firemorfox]: Take the hardest courses I can when I start engineering uni, I can graduate faster!
No, instead I was way out of my water and lost my scholarship. I 
would have graduated 1 year early. Instead, I did horribly on the start,
 AND graduating 2 years late because it took me 3 years to recover.
[TopYam9663]: Honestly can’t really remember most of the advice I’ve gotten. 
It’s all cliche and everything everyone says goes against at least like 
five other peoples words. I’m just gonna follow my heart and do what 
works. Find my tribe and keep my head up at least some of the time.
[Salt-Explanation-738]: Yeah, about the same. x I have worked so hard my entire life, and 
I’m really struggling at the moment. I don’t know if I should switch 
fields or what. And I wish my sense of self-worth wasn’t so tied to 
traditional measures of success.
[redray_76]: In the real world yes, in the Reddit world no.
[pcfirstbuild]: For people that feel this way about never being able to get ahead,
 the only way out is through politics I'm sorry to say. Support 
progressive taxation (rich should pay more than you), unionize for 
collective bargaining power, universal health care to save money, and 
considering supporting UBI, and less restrictive zoning laws so we can 
build more housing and bring prices down.
[Confident-Software20]: What's wrong with working hard?
Ig it’s just the way it’s meant. A lot of older people when they 
see younger people struggling just say work harder even though the job 
market and economy has completely changed since they were younger and 
the cost of living is much higher. Many people work hard but aren’t 
rewarded the same as the older generations had it when they were 
younger, so a lot of older people might just think young people aren’t 
working hard enough.
It’s kinda similar to the phrase “bad things happen to good 
people”. You can do everything right and work your butt off and that 
doesn’t mean you are gonna succeed”. Good chance you will, but not a 
guarantee.

Take off the pajamas and get moving
You have to work

literally don’t even know what to do anymore at this point lol. 
lately i’ve been just doing a coin toss every morning to see if i should
 call out or not (pretty sure i’m in negative pto hours 🫠). when i am 
at work, i feel like i’m just doing the bare minimum to not get fired, 
but at this point they’ll probably fire me cause of attendance. but i 
don’t even give a fck anymore. but i do give a fck about paying bills 🥲
 been applying and not really hearing back. like i’d be down to do 
anything that doesn’t require me to customer service dumbass people 
everyday.
i just feel like a total asshole bc my partner is out here 
traveling for work every week and i’m just here, spiraling at home. i’m 
so stuck in this loop of loathing. if any of you have gone through this

interesting. A dance class or painting or anything like that. Iv been 
working full time on and off since I was 14 and jobs get so boring once 
you know how to do them. Spice it up! When there’s something to look 
forward to after work it makes things easier but don’t just go home, it 
will make everything boring. I like to go write stories and go to coffee
 shops and restaurants after work.

Lately I’ve been feeling a weird kind of burnout with mainstream 
social media. I’ve been online since around 2010 , making friends, 
sharing life updates, exchanging gifts  and I used to love the 
interactive atmosphere.
But over the last few years, something’s changed. Everything 
feels… performative. Every app seems to push the same trends, the same 
recycled content, and the same pressure to post something “interesting” 
or perfectly curated. And the moment I put up a photo, I catch myself 
worrying about likes, follows, or whether I’m being judged ,even when I 
tell myself I shouldn’t care.
I still use Instagram mainly to keep up with real-life friends, 
but if it weren’t for them, I think I would’ve left already. I miss the 
feeling of posting just to express something, not to perform for an 
invisible audience or an algorithm.
Is anyone else feeling this?
Are there any niche or smaller social platforms where you can just
 exist without the pressure to impress or something that feels more like
 hanging out than competing?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[alyakimmikayla]: Totally feel like this too, I feel like the platform has been this
 way always, but it’s definitely been worse post Covid. I delete and 
redownload Instagram quite a bit. Yeah, I’ll likely redownload, but the 
spurts of delete time are a nice little break for my brain.
[kristen-outof-ten]: totally agree. I used to have SO much fun on social media. 
especially since Trump was elected for the second time it took a 
dramatic change. imo it's because the algorithm has gotten so good most 
of it only shows you what you like the most or whatever feeds your 
anger, so you never see new things anymore. I mostly only use YouTube 
now and even trying to pick a video on YouTube feels like it's all the 
same shit. and if you go on insta or tiktok it tries to show you stuff 
that'll piss you off because that's how most people keep engaging. like 
how "top comments" aren't the most enjoyed but the most controversial 
comment that literally nobody agrees with. I seriously miss the internet
 I grew up with in like a weird way. it made me feel less alone and it 
made me understand people better as a teenager. now all it makes you do 
is feel more alone. and it's only going to continue to feel more lonely 
with the rise in AI. I dont even have social media downloaded anymore.
[BrooklynNotNY]: Yeah, somewhere around 2014 people seemed to start wanting 
perfectly curated profiles on IG. Instead of having 10+ pictures on 
their profile they’d only have like 1 picture posted at a time. Or 
people would go in and unfollow a bunch of people to make it seem like 
they had “fans”. It stopped being a place to post fun and funny pictures
 with friends. Now everything close to fun is cringe and corny.
I think it all started with snapchat and their filters + 
kardashians influence, making everyone want to post perfect pics instead
 of fun, in-the-moment ones
[Wellbeinghunter69]: I think it all started with snapchat and their filters +

[untrustedlife2]: Tumblr and Mastadon. Bluesky is okay too. I deleted my instagram, 
Twitter, threads, and I don’t go on Snapchat. And moved to tumblr and 
bluesky (I already had mastadon) and haven’t really looked back also 
feel way less addicted.
[poptimist185]: I was around when Facebook started and can’t remember it not being
 performative. “Look how exciting my life is! All these parties and 
travelling”
[betteroffw]: I went from performing in 2015-2023 to nothing at all. Don't have 
insta, twitter and don't post myself anymore. I've chosen the anonymous 
life of just scrolling reddit and tiktok and it has taken away the fear 
of being perceived.
[Old_Question7185]: Pinterest, Bondee . Compared to main social media,they are more peaceful.
[JoeMamma559]: Yea. It’s getting worse and worse. I only have Snapchat for my 
friends and Facebook for my family. I wish there were a new type of 
platform younger generations like us could communicate on. Without ads 
and scrolling. A new way to communicate and share things. Maybe one day.

hi everyone. 23F from the uk and ive noticed how having a real 
personality, passions and interests are deemed cringe. everyone wants to
 stay mysterious nowadays, almost detached and apathetic. its kinda 
scary
and i get it, we’ve grown up in a world thatconstantlypushes despair — climate collapse, economy gone to shit, wars 
everywhere, social media influence. it creates this collective burnout 
before we’ve even had the chance to live. apathy feels like the only 
survival mechanism sometimes.
im the eldest in my family, and my siblings are almost robotic. 
they pretty much have the same front they put on. its sad for me to see 
as the oldest because they once had so much love and light in them and 
was so curious about the world. and i dont wanna sound like a mum, but 
they dont pursue those dreams, they couldnt give a fuck about school and
 they quite simply just dont care??!
its a similar vibe within my friend groups. ive struggled to find 
like minded individuals who want to keep trying and pushing forward even
 tho times are shitty rn. most of my friends dont put effort into 
anything, they say they wanna do things but dont make steps to do it - i
 understand money and time is a big factor too, theres small steps you 
can take but they seem to just shrug it off.
its almost as if all the motivation has been sucked out of gen z, 
in the uk especially. the majority of the world dont lead with their 
hearts and a sense of empathy.
has gen z just fully given up? or am i just overthinking it more than i should?

From what I've seen people in their early 20s don't have a ton of 
earning potential so they float along kind of going with the idea of 
"fuck it, why try when you're never going to get ahead." Then they get 
more work experience, get a better job, get more life responsibilities 
like a partner or family and slowly that turns into "ok well, I guess 
I'll try a little because I kind of have to now." Then they build more 
earning potential, make some big purchases that require monthly payments
 and try a little becomes trying to climb the ladder to improve their 
lifestyle further.
By the time they're in their 40s they have a career and lots of 
responsibilities and they look at 20 year olds who they complain are 
lazy and don't want to try.
Gen X spent the 90s talking about how much "the man" sucked and 
now they're the corporate leaders who are pushing back to the office 
rules.

[Quailking2003]: The cynicism and nihlism is real, and I am an optimist passionate 
for the environment and transport. I will admit this climate is awful
yes! i have a passion for the arts, architecture and the 
environment. ive been in work for 2 years since graduating and everyone i
 work with is so cynical and negative about the future of the industry. 
it puts me off sometimes. mind you that i work with millennials and 
young gen X's
I especially love birds, other wildlife, fish, planes, trains and 
space exploration. I am am optimist and I like imagine sustainable, 
climate adapted futures
see! this is wholesome! please keep following your passions and interest
Thanks, ironically, most people in my Gen z circle have been supportive!
im really glad to hear that! keep it up :) sending love!

[Chemical-Village-211]: Many people don't care about everything after 2020. There will 
come a time when everything turns back to normal. Influencer obsession 
will die down, people won't mind coming into an office, people will 
pursue their profession with more passion, etc. Give it 5-10 more years.

Well the alternative is accepting getting dicked down by life and 
doom posting, and idk about you, but I'm not for that. So we'll keep 
trying until we make this shit hole somewhat better
were in the same boat. i could sit and rot in bed. but i actually 
want to try and make something for myself and help others in some way, 
shape or form. god forbid that one day i might have kids, and if i do, 
id ideally want to create a better life for them
And when the time comes (not so far away) y'all need to start 
running for office.  Its not enough to just vote this time. (though that
 would be good too) The best thing you can do right now is to get your 
fellow Zeds to start getting involved now.  Maybe one of  your passions 
should be activism.  Thats not cringe, its making change at a local 
level. Organizing can help with hopelessness. And getting out and 
meeting people is where the rest of your life starts.

[cold_anchor]: Gen z will collectively grow out of it. I'm a younger millenial 
and saw it happen with the older millenials too. Gen X were famously 
complacent slackers
i sure hope so. cos the uk doesnt look great rn

[Drunken_Russ1an]: Kali Yuga is on its early stages, giving its first fruits. That's 
why everyone is in despair. Because everyone realize that there is 
something wrong with this world.
Doesn’t Kali Yuga last like 500k years? So we’ve been cooked for 
all of human history and will continue to be cooked for most of the 
observable future
what is kali yuga?
Some religious belief stemming from Hinduism, in my personal view 
it's best to not let something that may or may not exist affect your 
feelings harmfully
Love this.

[nirvana6789]: I think it’s less that Gen Z doesn’t care and more that we’re 
tired of playing by rules that don’t work anymore. For some, ‘not 
trying’ is actually a rejection of burnout culture. But I do agree that 
we need to find healthier ways to stay motivated and connected, 
otherwise it just spirals into apathy.
definitely! its such a shame. the uk theres over 1M young people 
unemployed and out of education and the gov says there putting 
strategies in place. but nothing has changed from what i can see. uk gen
 z still have the same attitudes.

[Egnatsu50]: I think its by design...
so you think the system was purposely designed to be this way?
No...
I think there are efforts to cause hate, division, hopelessness among western populations.
I don't think life is easy, but it hasn't been for many 
generations.  One of the US greatest things is the ability of our 
culture to overcome and adapt.
Seems like a huge effort on social media for hopelessness but I don't see it in real life.

[mak756]: I tell my Gen Z sons that they don’t need to outrun the lion, they
 just need to be faster than the next guy. Let their peers have their 
cynicism and nihilism. While others lie flat, run with perseverance the 
race marked out for you.
my dads a young gen x and is so negative about everything. reading this comment gave me some sense of direction. thank you

[coffeewalnut08]: Live in the U.K. and have seen similar patterns. It’s quite sad 
really, but it’s good to try and find more inspiring people
a lot of the people in the comments keep telling me how im in some
 sort of bubble. this is quite literally the behaviour of the majority 
of my age in the uk. idk how else to explain it.

[Mas0n8or]: I notice this too but I think “giving up” is a major 
oversimplification. They are not ambition-less people, they have been 
pushed into survival mode by living in a parasitic environment, like a 
biological reaction. Really most of them are still kids just figuring 
out that they have been born into a world designed to lie to and take 
advantage of them. It takes a lot of skillful dissonance and some 
personal philosophy to be able to acknowledge this and then still try 
super hard at anything, not something that comes easily when you truly 
have no hope.
Social media and easy dopamine amplifies the issue for sure but we
 will never see a return of widespread ambition without things like jobs
 that pay enough to raise a family, accessible healthcare, and basic 
justice.
[StretchTucker]: you’re definitely in a bubble because that’s not my experience at all
enlighten me, whats going on in your bubble
[miya-isbored]: enlighten me, whats going on in your bubble
[misscherie04]: I don’t know if it’s gen z but seeing the reactions on social 
media of people so nonchalant failing their GCSEs was pretty wild for me
 as a 29 year old
[James-Dicker]: Low motivation from constant dopamine burnout
[ComprehensiveArm3493]: Idk, right now I'm focusing on relations with other people, but if
 I get rejected by a girl again, I'll probably really stop trying
instead of focussing on relationships, isnt it better to focus on 
yourself, education, career ? etc. our generation is cooked when it 
comes to any sort of commitment atm
Why would I focus on education or career? To have better numbers? To have more money? For what?

[JesusGiftedMeHead]: Lol we're numb. I turn it on for work but once im off, I too put 
on the mysterious front. For myself, people are exhausting and Id rather
 tune them out on my way home from work. However I live in a city, 
unsure how it is for folks living in the burbs
dont get me wrong, i do have my 'stay numb and carry on' moments. 
but i feel like i naturally wear my heart on my sleeve and try to look 
for the best in others. i live in the suburbs and travel to the city 
everyday for work. in london, almost nobody has a smile on their faces. 
its a negative aura. i do my best to keep a smile on and enjoy this life
 whilst the chaos is happening
That's pretty cool. You're the hero London needs lol. If I could 
take a second crack at my earlier post, I think COVID was probably one 
of the worst things to happen because everyone had to change one thing 
or another about their lives. Like sure I had the physical virus for a 
week but the global impact was crazy. I was going to take a cross 
country road trip with the boys but then we went into lockdown. I ended 
going to Vegas but damn it was a complete ghost town. Being in LA at the
 time, it was soo eeerie going down the 5 freeway and there'd be so so 
so few cars you'd be alone sometimes. Even the smog was gone. Now that 
im SF, theechoes of covidstill linger. Downtown prob has less
 than 30 stores if you were to count down market st end to end. As 
someone who works downtown, most people who aren't tourists look like 
they've been beaten up by life. I definitely have but thats a story for 
another time lol. In closing, the world (i think) is also on fire. My 
government sucks, other world governments suck. A handful of groceries 
is like $100. We won't build more housing yet we'll dump millions into 
tech. Idk im sick of it, and i think others are too

[catshark2o9]: I don't blame you all for giving up, the world sucks so bad. I'm 
almost 50 and if I was that young I'd be the same way. The prospect of 
having to work until I am 70+ has me fucked up right now as it is.
[Project_Demosthenes_]: I think that many GenZ/Millenial people feel a real sense of 
hopelessness/purposelessness/apathy towards their environment/society at
 a large scale that most people don't understand, especially if you tend
 to be a optimistic person in general. This is a much deeper issue than a
 lot of people are willing to acknowledge. Between climate change, 
exponentially increasing wealth inequality, limited job/future career 
prospects decreasing, being priced out of any meaningful economic 
mobility, etc, many GenZ/M feel like "giving up" is literally the only 
option.
[Any-Common-5588]: (25F) I have not given up but I’ve given less fucks compared to 
being 18/19. Feel a bit less alive but more wise, that’s the gift of 
discernment.
[gothfangsx]: I got hurt and betrayed when I was being real, now it's easier to be detached and to only look out for myself.
thats understandable. and im sorry you had to go through the hurt 
<3 i guess it can be easier to be detached. but it doesnt always mean
 its the best decision. looking out for yourself is a plus. but please 
dont essentially block off who you are, just because life put you down. 
sending love!

[XViMusic]: I had a major overhaul of my social circle when I moved from the 
drug addled crowd toward academia. If that taught me anything, it’s that
 there’s a breadth of aspirations and personalities in every generation,
 and if you hold monolithic opinions about a generation, it probably has
 a lot more to do with your circle than the generation itself.
[Taur_ie]: I know people like this and I know people that are as far from 
this as you can get. The people that have given up are people that are 
chronically online, and the people that haven’t aren’t.
[J2Mags]: This isn't your question, but I applaude anyone who bucks the trend of apathy and actually does try.
The world is tough but the best thing us as individuals can do is to keep doing our best and try to lead the way.
the world is tough for sure, and my heart goes out to those 
individuals in the world who havent given up and are still persevering 
:)
[miya-isbored]: the world is tough for sure, and my heart goes out to those

[Fine_Comparison445]: I think it’s more of a UK than genz thing. I say it as someone from the Uk
yeah i have a lof of people in the comments saying its a social 
circle thing. when in reality its quite literally the attitudes of the 
people in the uk
[miya-isbored]: yeah i have a lof of people in the comments saying its a social

[Rapn3rd]: Fwiw when I was gen Zs age many millennials also had a too cool to
 care vibe. I think being young and being afraid to be vulnerable and 
put yourself put there are pretty intrinsically linked.
It’s probably worse now, but may of my peers in highschool and college were also often like this.
I imagine social media and the state of the world has accelerated 
it but I wouldnt say its exclusively a gen z feature.
[[deleted]]: The one time in the past few decades that suicide declined was 
during the darkest part of Covid. For a brief period, society was united
 in battle against a common enemy.
That tells you the depression does not arise from objective 
problems, but from a particular mindset you're being fed every day.
[[deleted]]: Theow away the damn smart phone. Buy the dumb one that just makes 
calls and send texts. In a few days, you’ll feel the real depth of life.
it really be that phone
[miya-isbored]: it really be that phone
[Mbiyxoaim]: Gen Z is largely detached, nihilistic, and exhausted. Frequent 
judgement and loss of hope has killed creativity or authenticity.
[Mister_Oux]: 26M in the deep south of US. Times are tough, but I refuse to give
 in. Statistically I will live till 70, and no one else is coming to 
save me. So I will build the best future possible for my wife and I.
[Lightsneeze2001]: It’s not that the world pushes despair, it’s that despair is 
pushed onto us specifically. Our generation is fighting for our lives 
for everything all because of old, elite capitalists loving money and 
power too much.
[msCupidKiller]: I felt like this until I unplugged (besides an occasional Reddit visit)
Also being friends with older people really helps. Its only a 
problem if you want it to be, you can be the change. The good people are
 the ones with the quietest opinions and who generally keep things 
lowkey. Youre bound to be attentive to those who don’t.
[Dazzling-Frosting525]: Yeah. There seems to be no hope as all the important positions of 
power are held by boomers. I'm not surprised that this generation has 
such negative attitudes towards moving up the ladder.
[Educational_Ad_4225]: If you want to change the world, be that change.

[Marsiangirl19]: so i’m not the only one who thinks this…? i thought i was going 
crazy when i said gen z is gen x pt.2, but with all the worst traits of a
 teenager amplified
[EditaPita]: The way I’ve become so jaded & apathetic these past 3 years is remarkable 🙃
[Ok_Metoo70]: Is it “cringe” to be resilient?  Generations before us seemed to 
handle tougher situations with gumption.  Can you imagine if they had 
given up so easily.
[Weird-Tiger-3124]: When everyone is drowning in quick pleasure water how can you 
expect people to build boats to sail, for them drowning is pleasure 
doesn't matter if they die in the process.
[DaddysFriend]: What is with these silly posts about gen Z no doing things. I’m so
 lost. Some do and some don’t. Who cares what others are doing honestly
this is what i mean. theres zero sense of community. everyone is 
negative. its always 'if its not happening to me then i dont care' 
attitude. im not referring to everyone but its the majority, and the 
number increases. what ever happened to looking out for others?

[Swansaknight]: No that’s just your circle, Gen Z isnt a hive mind.
[Feeling-Currency6212]: We live in a world that is about to become very dystopian with AI.
 The past 3 months have been insanely brutal for US job seekers. What 
does Gen Z have to look forward to in the future?
[TPatientZero]: Well it’s going to get worse in this next decade so good luck.
[ChemFire666]: Do you blame them?
[Wxskater]: Yup.
[Naive-Asparagus-5983]: Genz is still in HS. So it give it some time
[speedymitsu3000]: I've met genZs that are apathetic completely because no matter 
what they do, the world is going to shit. But I've also met super 
ambitious hustlers that go to ivy league and start tech companies or go 
to Wall Street so they can secure their own bag and live comfortably in 
this shit world
[andycmade]: I seen this too and and I feel that is that the systems are 
breaking so when the millennials were kids it was starting to break but 
it was still working: the system of school and work and just capitalism 
in general. But now we started to see the cracks and I think young 
people are just confused as what to do now. Should I get a job go to 
school or should I become an entrepreneur or should I be a content 
creator? All very cringe things because anything new that you don't
 know what you're doing is going to look cringe to others.
Also, in the past people improve themselves before making it 
public. For example, actors or singers would sing and act in silence 
until they were better and then they showed it to the world. But now 
people are just starting right on the internet and showing people their 
Journey. So I also think that adds to the cringe factors.
I truly feel people have become like NPCs because everything is 
hard to make a choice on so they just go on with whatever is going on 
and are asleep basically because it's too stressful.
[vox_libero_girl]: I hope we do. People only join revolutions when they feel they’ve got nothing left to lose, they become ungovernable.

TÍTULO: Gen Z has issues. : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I am a 17 years old girl who was violently raped and gangraped, 
choked until I passed out and held at knifepoint a few years ago by a 
sadistic pervert and his friends (on multiple occasions) and it just... 
It makes me feel so angry when people say they have PTSD for the 
stupidest, smallest things. FFS. YOU DON'T HAVE PTSD BECAUSE YOUR CAT 
RAN AWAY ONCE. YOU DONT HAVE PTSD BECAUSE YOU WERE BULLIED A LITTLE BIT 
WHEN YOU WERE 8. READ ABOUT SHELL SHOCKED WAR VETERANS. READ ABOUT 
KIDNAPPING AND RAPE SURVIVORS. THAT IS PTSD.
It fucking pisses me off when people say they have OCD just 
because they like to keep their pens neat. OCD it is a real and 
debilitating condition that ruins people's lives! One of my siblings has
 it and it's heartbreaking to see him struggle to function throughout 
each day because of it, and hear people in my class say "oh that's so 
OCD of you" to people who are neat. My brother obsessively washes his 
hands, multiple times an hour. His hands are red and raw. There was a 
point in his teens when he refused to eat any food my parents cooked due
 to them being "contaminated". He could barely leave the house and go 
out in public. Would wait by doors for hours for somebody to come and 
open it. He's an adult now and is getting a lot better.
And ADHD and autism. Oh my goodness. I'm not even going to go into
 that but the amount of people that exaggerate about normal things and 
collect mental health conditions like their Pokemons or cool trophies to
 put on your social media profile... Who act as if it's cool, it's a 
"quirk" and do tests for them like they're personality tests and try to 
get diagnosed to be "different".
It's just so diminishing to real suffers. Gen Z has such an issue 
of glorifying mental health problems. I'm all for destigmatising but 
this? It's not right.
Like someone is tired/overwhelmed but no, it's 
anxiety/burnout/some fancier mental health term to describe it. I hate 
how people throw around clinical mental health stuff without really 
understanding it.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[FroggyChairAC1]: People romanticize having issues
Yeah... It's so frustrating
I don't think it's always about romanticism. I think it's 
perfectly natural for people to want answers for themselves for 
behaviors they're insecure about, or behaviors they've noticed aren't as
 prominent in other people. People like reassurance that their 
individuality isn't something they're doing wrong. Sure, some people do 
it because they want to be different, or get attention, and some people 
do it to fit in, and some people do it so they can wash their hands of 
responsibility for their actions. That being said, I think it's 
invalidating to assume so many people are doing it for nefarious 
reasons.
So true.
[An0nymous_777]: Yeah... It's so frustrating

 prominent in other people. People like reassurance that their 
individuality isn't something they're doing wrong. Sure, some people do 
it because they want to be different, or get attention, and some people 
do it to fit in, and some people do it so they can wash their hands of 
responsibility for their actions. That being said, I think it's 
invalidating to assume so many people are doing it for nefarious 
reasons.
[[deleted]]: So true.
[RoyalZeal]: I'm very sorry about what you went through, and my heart goes out to you for that, but I'm going to gently push back.
PTSD can be caused by a much broader range of things that one 
might think, and it doesn't have to be life-changing trauma to stick. 
I'll give you a for instance. I had a dog that would occasionally bite. 
Not all the time, not even most of the time, but when you least expected
 it he'd snap at you. Had him for a couple years, he was my wife's dog. 
To this day, I can't be around Corgis, especially when they bark.Anydog bark at a frequency close enough triggers a shutdown, and I'm a 
lifelong dog lover. It's bad enough that it requires half a day of 
meditation or medication.
Again, this is not to minimize your trauma and what you went 
through, but it does not have to be something so heavy to mess you up 
for years. The human brain is a messy bowl of jelly that runs off of 
phantom electrical signals. The fact is we still don't understand a 
great deal about mental health, and the stigma is still incredibly 
heavy. Therearea lot of people talking about these issues, 
because we are, as a species, very slowly warming up to the concept that
 it should be talked about, and they're every bit as common as physical 
health issues.
Thanks, and yeah, I know, it doesn't have to be life changing 
trauma to stick. I was scared of dogs for most of my childhood too due 
to one chasing me in the park when I was 8, so I get that.
I just mean how I don't like when people say stuff like that you 
have OCD because you like to keep your pens neat, or you're autistic 
just because you have an obsession with trains.

[Dove-a-DeeDoo]: Same for chronic illnesses. It's all jokes about diabetes and 
cancer scams until you get then yourself and realize what it's actually 
like.
[Dr-Jim-Richolds]: The problem here is that WAY too many people self diagnose because
 they watched a tiktok and then spread nefarious lies or perpetuation to
 keep up the victim stigma
[[deleted]]: No. You need to go to therapy and focus on yourself instead of 
projecting and thinking you know what other people have and do not have 
or go through based on your limited knowledge and insight on their life.
You are projecting your anger at the wrong people.
The reason people do not believe you or do not give a fck about 
your mental health and so on is not "all those other bad bad people who 
make it so hard for YOU to be taken seriously, unlike everyone else!". 
The reason is because our societies have normalised rape culture, are 
ableist and do not care for peoples physical or mental health. Also 
because people tend to play disability Olympic- if you tell people often
 enough that whatever they went through "is not AS BAD as xyz, which is a
 REAL problem" unlike theirs, you just build a society that eventually 
does not gaf or care about anyone and also selectively gets to dismiss 
peoples trauma or problems cause "hey it is not even so bad".
Just because you went through something very traumatic - does not 
make you an expert on trauma on other peoples mental health or means you
 are entitled to tell other people how bad their mental health is.
Some people lie about certain events, because something bad 
happened to them and they will never ever share it with anyone on this 
earth and they make things up instead to cope. It is their only way to 
get sympathy, communicate they they are stressed or their life is 
affected or communicating they are not well - without telling the truth.
Some people are truly having ptsd triggers, a lot of things can 
cause ptsd - not just being in war or being raped. It is simply wrong to
 reduce and gatekeep something like PTSD to events only you approve of 
and think are "traumatizing" enough. Yes harassment and bullying and 
being in a high stress situation can absolutely cause ptsd.
Plus, people, including young people, have been always using language in more than just a professional setting.
I have seen a lot of people like you and it is nearly always 
entitled or privileged people who think everyone is as privileged as 
them to get diagnosed / treatment or and mental health support, when 
most will never be able to afford that (like you talking here about ADHD
 and autism), just because more people gain awareness how specific 
struggles or conditions actually look like OR simply people those are 
disabled or have mental health issues and directing their anger at the 
wrong people.
I have heard people say all kinds of shit all my life. And I would
 never ignore or gaslight someone with a trauma. Never ever has someone 
saying things stopped me from caring. So no, those kids you think 
overreacting or lying or whatever goes through your head are NEVER the 
reason why our society does not take peoples mental health or physical 
health seriously. The reason for that is rooted in historical reality 
and was also alresdy a thing way before the internet and way before we 
even had proper words to label things like PTSD or OCD.
Stop weaponizing your own trauma to talk over other people, tone 
police them, gate keep mental health problems and issues of other 
people. It is gross. Yikes.
And btw this "nowadays blablabla" bullshit narrative is also 
always used by ignorant and problematic people. "Nowadays everyone is 
gay or trans" (just because it is more socially acceptable to come out 
or talk about it or more people understand what they themselves are 
going through in society). "Nowadays everyone has some kind of mental 
illness" (just because more people have access to mental health support 
than we used to have and more people who do not, still get educated on 
how mental health problems can look like and how they can cope with 
their struggles). The list goes on and on. And 9/10 people upset about 
that shit - are problematic people.
And the "ha your life is so easy, xyz is not even a REAL problem, 
get over it" is ALWAYS weaponized to silence people / gaslight people 
and at the end of the day, silence disabled people and people with 
mental health issues. So while OP right now feels a "high" and how they -
 unlike everyone else knows "real" trauma - trust, this will eventually 
be also used against them. One day someone will come along and tell a 
story about some girl that was raped for 10 years as a child and "well 
they are fine now, so why are you complaining / acting as if it is so 
bad OP". Some people are just lucky that they never got this shit thrown
 in their face. And OP does not get to wiesel out for enabling those 
kind of people cause "well I went through trauma so it is ok if I say / 
think this kind of shit". Yes - there is ALWAYS someone else out there 
who had it "much much worse". That is irrelevant. A person is not living
 another persons life, they only live their only experiences anr with 
their own body and so on. Jfc. But the comments are ofc also already 
filled with losers who absolutely will use OP as an example to silence 
or ridicule people with mental health issues and disabilities. As 
expected.
I agree. But let’s remember that OP is obviously not okay and just
 aggressively tearing them down for a hopefully mistaken and clouded POV
 isn’t helping.
She has every right to get angry because of the lack of 
seriousness mental health and trauma and youth sees, because it’s true. 
But going at her throat because she came after someone else’s isn’t 
helping.
This is perfection

[stonkykong3]: I promise it’s a not a competition
[CrowdGoesWildWoooo]: How people make their identities around whatever tag they can put under their profile username is just crazy
Yeah
[An0nymous_777]: Yeah
[KitNitIt4800]: It is probably a mix of a few things. One, people don't take 
smaller traumas seriously, so forcing on a more serious label could help
 with that. Like, being yelled at a lot of a child can make hearing it 
as an adult "triggering" but that term has been so gutted and demonized 
now that it is hard to get across that it actually does negatively 
affect you. So calling it PTSD may make people actually try to work 
around it.
Two, a lot of these people probably do have mental health issues 
but may not have the support, finances or capabilities to get a proper 
diagnosis. A teenager probably isn't getting tested for autism if the 
parents don't want them to. An adult with autism could also be masking, 
so that is just generally harder to diagnose and why it's harder to tell
 if it is "just them having weird habits or being actually autistic."
Three, we are too involved in each others lives and not studying 
the sources. Even someone with mental health issues will likely struggle
 with explaining them, so using others as a source of self-diagnosis is 
not a great idea. Again, autism is a great example because it is such an
 umbrella term. Some with it can function day to day just fine, while 
others need 24/7 care. It is even difficult for professionals to 
diagnose, so just saying I have this, this and this probably isn't 
enough. It is good to notice things and take them to be properly 
diagnosed but going around with 100% confidence that you have it is a 
jump too soon.
Personally, as long as you make it clear that you're not properly 
diagnosed and don't talk like you're teaching non-sufferers about it, I 
think it's fine. It is really difficult to function in a world when you 
can't describe how you feel in it and, unfortunately, it is just easier 
for people to assume things and work around them when you explain them 
in mental health terms - even if they are technically incorrect. 
Additionally, at least in the US, any tests -(again, autism) can be 
extremely expensive, especially if you are struggling already due to 
mental health and could find difficulty in saving for it.
I'm not saying you can't feel how you feel, it is horrible what you went through. This is just my two cents on the matter.
Very useful insight and I agree
[An0nymous_777]: Very useful insight and I agree
[[deleted]]: Comment deleted by user
[Sky_Shocker0]: Hi!
I definitely agree that our societies are very desensitized to 
trauma and the real burdens that can come with mental disorders. And 
unfortunately it has become romanticized to the point that many people 
have “lost the plot”.
I’m terribly sorry what happened to you. No one should ever have 
to go through that, and most certainly never have the weight of that 
experience diminished to a “flight of fancy”. But putting down others 
experiences so aggressively isn’t really great either. And again that’s 
not to say your struggle was any less important, but that doesn’t mean 
others’ experiences weren’t traumatizing either.
I have cases of extreme anxiety and depression from my childhood. I
 was never beaten or abused, and I was never neglected. But that doesn’t
 mean I’m not facing real consequences from how I was raised. If someone
 startles me while I’m in the kitchen, I can sometimes get so upset I 
start to cry, even at work. I can get severe panic attacks if a child 
approaches me.
But my struggle wasn’t any less real just because it wasn’t an 
extreme. And neither was my brother’s, or my boyfriend’s, or my little 
sister who’s still growing up in that house.
You’re more than owed the opportunity to get angry that our 
society doesn’t take shit like this more seriously, because it should. 
But please don’t put other people down because “they suffered less”.
[[deleted]]: So we’re gatekeeping trauma now? That’s so gen z.
I’m sorry that this happened to you but you don’t get to invalidate Everyone else.
People who belong to xyz group always love to weaponize their own 
identity to gatekeep whatever topic fits them - cause they think just 
cause they went through x, they are the spokesperson for everyone else 
and know what everyone else goes through and also get to decide for 
others how bad it is or how bad it affects them.
And society in general loves to gaslight and silence people with 
disabilities and so on, they gobble it up whenever someone comes up to 
support their narrative.
It is like a desperate right winger who is looking for that one 
Black or brown person to support their rhetoric and then claim "see I am
 right! That Black / brown person AGREES with me!".
So all those ignorant people who think "Oh NoWAdAYS EvEryOnE HaS 
SomEtHiNg anD CoLleCts MenTaL HeAlTh ISsuEs LiKe PoKemOn" listen to this
 nonsense and are like "wow I could not agree more, finally a person 
with a trauma I respect, unlike all those other posers". Uah. And OP is 
clearly too upset to acknowledge that their narrative is harmful, being 
defensive instead and directing their anger at the wrong people.
But if you like to keep your pens neat that doesn't mean you 
have OCD... and just because someone likes trains doesn't mean that 
makes them autistic... am I really wrong for thinking this?
No? But you’re making some pretty broad assumptions and 
accusations that you’d think that someone with a legitimate mental issue
 would understand isn’t so cut and dry black and white.
What do you mean? Sorry I'm kinda struggling to understand
You know OCD isn’t about just keeping things tidy right…
Yes... I know that... I never said OCD is "just about keeping things tidy"...?
The point I’m trying to make is just because your event that 
happened to you was inherently traumatic, it’s really shitty to say you 
don’t have this or you don’t have that because your trigger isn’t/wasn’t
 traumatic. You are invalidating others without knowing anything about 
them aside from what you can see on the outside

Post TRAUMATIC stress disorder..?

I got that.
“ Yeah, I don't think you get what I've said.
Everyone experiences trauma. Not all trauma results in severe 
enough symptoms to be labeled post-traumatic stress disorder. That's the
 distinction you're not seeing.
It's perfectly valid to say, "I was traumatized by the death of my cat."
It's not so valid to say, "I have PTSD because of my cat dying," without a diagnosis.
The disorder label in general has to do with the severity and 
frequency of symptoms and the effect it has on one's ability to 
function. One can feel depressed without having major depressive 
disorder. One can feel anxious without having an anxiety disorder. “

[Degenerate2Throwaway]: I just read the first few words and felt sick to the stomach. Are you okay?
I skimmed through the rest of your post, I agree that a lot of 
people overexaggerate their issues. Yes, little Tommy, you're valid for 
being hurt by bullies. People are only mad because you claim you got 
PTSD from "you stink, you're ugly."
I have ADHD and from what I've noticed, people think having ADHD 
is just being a little quirky. It is by no means something about being a
 little different. It's a learning issue. It's about the brain. How you 
get motivated, etc. At least that's how I feel.
I truly want to do something, hype myself up, then blankly stare 
at a screen, then insult myself mentally because I couldn't do something
 so easy.
Then there are others who think having say tourettes is violently 
jumping around and yelling  24/7, and it's funny. While yes, there are 
severe tourettes that do make people make sounds a lot, it isn't 24/7, 
and it isn't funny. I once suffered severe tourettes for a while where I
 kept having to mess with my jaw and making weird "mm" sounds. I hated 
it.
I know what PTSD is, while I don't have PTSD, my sister does. I 
just suffer from childhood trauma. She and I experienced the same thing 
on different severities. She has PTSD due to being attacked, 
overpowered, yelled at, chased, and insulted by our extremely 
argumentative and abusive father. That's what PTSD really is. It's 
something that horrifies you. It's something that haunts you forever. I 
don't have PTSD, but that's what I've understood from my sister.
I'm so sorry to see what you've gone through. Don't let that 
experience define you. You're still a person that deserves happiness.
Not okay, never am, but thanks for asking :)
I absolutely agree with everything you've said, and I have ADHD too and I feel like that too.
And thank you.
[An0nymous_777]: Not okay, never am, but thanks for asking :)

[Parking-Top-2778]: yeah our generation really does have some kind of a fetish for 
mental illnesses. suddenly everyone has at least two, like bro what? 
they watch sad movies and listen to depressing songs, say they have ADHD
 because they can’t focus on homework or depression because they’re too 
lazy to go work out every now and then
EXACTLY
[An0nymous_777]: EXACTLY
[[deleted]]: I agree with you
THANK YOU
[An0nymous_777]: THANK YOU
[TransLox]: Also: people will just refuse to respect the boundaries of people with PTSD.
A guy I knew made it a fucking game to see how much he could get 
me, a person who was physically abused for 14 years, to flinch. 
Unsurprisingly, he got me to flinch a lot.
Now I feel more unsafe than ever about being around physical or 
impulsive people. At random times, my brain will suddenly decide that a 
person who has never attempted to hurt me ever is coming over to attack 
me.
People treat mental illnesses with absolutely no reverence. At the
 best of times, it's watered down, and at the worst, it's permission for
 people to push your buttons on purpose because "ha ha, you flinched so 
hard that you fell out of your chair, so funny."
I explained to this guy that I have PTSD and he can't do shit like
 that on multiple occasions and every time he just one upped himself 
with dickishness. First he just ignored it, then he actively denied that
 I had PTSD, eventually he started making fun of me for being 
traumatized by something that "wasn't that bad."
Yeah. When I was 14 there was this one guy in my class who would touch me to make me flinch and he found it funny.
[An0nymous_777]: Yeah. When I was 14 there was this one guy in my class who would touch me to make me flinch and he found it funny.
[alex_x_726]: alright alright i get your point. but not everything is always so 
extreme. i have autism and adhd but i am managing it with medication. my
 autism gives me ocd symptoms, most concerning routine and intrusive 
thoughts. it’s not severe but it is debilitating. not being able to go 
to sleep until i have checked the doors multiple times and still being 
worried about the fact that someone could break in and unalive me in my 
sleep. i’m on the maximum dose of my adhd meds and have an extender to 
get me thru the evening, and i still couldn’t keep up with my singular 
class last semester, even though i understood the material. i got my 
first testing done for adhd when i was 11, and was diagnosed a year 
later at 12. i wasn’t diagnosed with autism until 17 because doctors 
don’t diagnose girls as much as boys. i had a child neurologist for 14 
years who didn’t notice and prescribed me random muscle strengtheners 
instead of doing the test for autism or anything else. i had an MRI at 
4. i did 6 hours of IQ testing, 5 years of therapy, a four week session 
at an autism specialist and so much other shit.
all of that to say, yeah people faking/glorifying mental illness 
is fucked up. but all of these diseases have spectrums and they aren’t 
all that severe. people can have more mild symptoms or have developed 
ways to cope with them. i’m able to live with my issues, and i know i 
don’t have the most severe case, but i do still struggle.
also im very sorry about what happened to you. i hope you are doing as well as you can
[joecee97]: Any traumatic experience can cause PTSD.
[cchapa1949]: I feel you. I was actually diagnosed with ADHD as a young child 
because of FAS but I don't go around making it the main thing in my life
 or use it an excuse all it really does now is make me a bigger dumbass 
than I already am 😂 All these fake adhd'ers make me laugh

experienced their feelings getting hurt or listen to some self-diagnosis
 tiktoks or reels.
side note: girl I hope you're doing better these days. Life gets 
better, I hope you are getting better with each and every day ahead of 
you
Yeah, and thank you
[An0nymous_777]: Yeah, and thank you
[onefourtygreenstream]: I'm so sorry that happened to you.
As someone with cPTSD, I absolutely understand your frustration. 
It's been very odd to hear people say 'and then that triggered my PTSD' 
when it objectively didn't.
I do also want to say that a person can get PTSD from anything 
traumatic, something negative outside of their control that they do not 
have the ability to process properly. Bullying can absolutely be 
traumatic and, depending on the circumstances, so can losing your pet. 
You can get PTSD from your parents divorce.  You can get PTSD from a
 bad storm. The events that gave me PTSD never left a single scratch on 
me, but it fucked up my life none the less.
I'm just trying to caution you against swinging too far in the 
other direction. Trauma can look like a lot of things, and the idea that
 PTSD can only be caused by violent trauma can be harmful as well.
[[deleted]]: It's just so diminishing to real suffers. Gen Z has such an issue 
of glorifying mental health problems. I'm all for destigmatising but 
this? It's not right.
I'm an older zoomer and I honestly feel like a lot of our 
generation is massively overcorrecting for the failings of past 
generations. My parents (Gen X) and many of my friend's parents had a 
lot of issues and just didn't address them, meanwhile I know a lot of 
Gen Zers (including my younger self) who put way too much stock in the 
stuff we have going on to the point where we're getting in the way of 
our own recovery. It's hard to watch sometimes, especially when those 
same people act like YOU'RE the crazy one for thinking we're capable of 
doing better.
Also I'm deeply sorry to hear about what you've been through. I hope you're able to heal with time.
Yeah, and thank you
[An0nymous_777]: Yeah, and thank you
[[deleted]]: I’ll never understand why some people love playing the victim card for the slightest inconveniences.
Yeah...
[An0nymous_777]: Yeah...
[Familiar-Shopping973]: My brother has PTSD and I don’t think anything that bad happened 
to him. But he heard voices and saw hallucinations and stuff really bad 
for a long time.
[Competitive-Dig-3120]: Romanticize mental illness is a millennial thing, once America quit institutionalizing people it became a fad
[GBM0125]: I’m about 10 years older than you and never agreed with anything 
on Reddit so much!!!!!! Thank you SO MUCH for posting!!! I have a 
similar backstory and the way some (mostly young) people claim PTSD with
 literally no professional diagnosis or even having undergone a life 
threatening trauma, is sickening, disheartening and belittling to those 
who have spent much of their life fearing for their life.
I wish you peace and healing on this very long road 💜
Thank you!!
[An0nymous_777]: Thank you!!
[Jin-Soo_Kwon]: This is why my generation and older generations hate dealing with 
Gen Z in the workplace. The amount of "baggage" gen z employees claim 
just makes it a minefield to navigate. Add on the other sensitivities 
such as pronouns ect. It's like we need a manual to just not to upset 
you to go over the ledge.
Exactly
[An0nymous_777]: Exactly
[Suicidalbagel27]: I don’t have any mental illnesses, but best believe I’m gonna call
 myself OCD when I have to change the volume on my TV to be an even 
number
[Pure-Government-1119]: Glorifying mental health problems is definitely wrong, and I’ll 
pray for your health, that what you went through can be burned with the 
fire of Jesus
Sorry what do you mean?
It means that whatever you went through and what you’re going through can be taken care of by Jesus himself.
[An0nymous_777]: Sorry what do you mean?
It means that whatever you went through and what you’re going through can be taken care of by Jesus himself.
[Pure-Government-1119]: It means that whatever you went through and what you’re going through can be taken care of by Jesus himself.
[Key-Candle8141]: I hate the victim Olympics ppl always think I'm trying to compete 
so I just don't talk about it certainly not in any detail on the 
internet
Theres no way unveiling your trauma for this lot would be a healthy choice so whenever I see it I wonder what the deal is
[[deleted]]: I have OCD so bad that it actually makes me scared of going out 
and how people will think of me and i just wanna disappear. Everytime I 
tell people they go “ you shouldn’t worry about that “ when i’ve tried 
my hardest to not think but rumination is always kicking my ass 😭 and 
they think i’m supposed to be neat when im the complete opposite and I 
think my OCD is getting worse to the point where I feel like reality 
doesn’t feel like it’s real
[odeacon]: Ok but adhd and autism are real things though .
Bro read the post... When did I say ADHD and autism aren't real things?
She never said they weren’t, she said many in this generation 
glorify and fake that shit for cool points seeing as being a victim is 
the coolest shit ever to gen z
Yes. Exactly. Thank you
Shaming them isn't going to help shit.
People who use rhetoric like this are doing more harm than good.
Some people fake shit sure, but I would argue there would still be a valid reason to do this.
And anyway all this sounds like is ignorant gatekeeping.
Also, I truly believe this issue of trauma IS as big as it seems like.
We are only slowly moving out of an era of emotional ignorance and
 society in general has always been harmful in many ways ; progress has 
always been met with opposition.
Honestly, feels like people have an ego issue with their mental 
health and neurological issues and want to feel more special and police 
others who claim they have problems too just because they don't sound 
"that bad".
I know someone in my own life who has been beat by their parents 
and even had bones broken more than once - without the parent taking 
accountability or responsibility for it. They've also been treated 
poorly by them verbally by being told they were never wanted in the 
first place - among other horrible verbal abuses.
Guess what? When she says she has ADHD ? No one believes her. I do.
But she also has a tendency to glorify her own sufferings as worse
 and that crap does get annoying. She fails to sympathize or have 
empathy for others trauma and pain and often acts 
psychopathic/narcissistic when it comes to others sufferings.
But if anyone fails to recognize that just because she says she 
has ADHD because "she hasn't been diagnosed" or "she thinks it's cool to
 be a victim" then they will only prevent her from healing.
As it is I truly believe that ADHD really is a trauma issue and if
 you want to gaslight and drive people from finding out the truth then 
you will only end up causing people to suppress and deny their own 
trauma because "it's not as bad as mine".
Its gatekeeping and it's harmful since people will likely fail to recover or find self compassion.
Trauma is harm, period. Everyone experiences some kind of pain and
 not everyone has the same capacity or even support to get through it. 
Most people will likely find coping mechanisms, addictions, and weird 
quirks because it's all people know. Its just the way pain/trauma work 
with every individual and it sucks to feel like we can't even do that 
without some jack holes denying we have a right to what flawed humans 
do.
Personally my go to way to manage is to do things like rock myself
 and even cry to emotional music. When I get shamed or feel a need to 
suppress? Doesn't fucking help shit! It makes me more unhinged, more 
weird, more covert, and more cold towards others.
If you want to deny us because something like abandonment doesn't 
sound as bad or neglect isn't as serious? Then YOU'RE the one that needs
 to get over your damn self.

[Simple-Street-4333]: Never heard a take on this subject that I've agreed with more than
 this one. Not really anything I can say to add on to your post other 
than I'm glad people are finally starting to call this stuff out for 
what it is which is just attention seeking. I hate the fact that there 
are people like you that had to go through those things and more often 
than not the pos never gets punished because the victim is too scared to
 come out about it for their own safety.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!! I have posted this post on various different 
subs and 90% of commenters are saying I'm really shitty and am 
"gatekeeping mental health" ("you don't get to decide who has trauma"). I
 feel like I'm going crazy and really am shity because my posts and 
comments on this topic are being downvoted to the depths of hell.

[Purple-Activity-194]: I am a 17 years old girl who was violently raped and gangraped, 
choked until I passed out and held at knifepoint a few years ago by a 
sadistic pervert and his friends (on multiple occasions) and it just... 
It makes me feel so angry when people say they have PTSD for the 
stupidest, smallest things.
How does this happen multiple genuinely curious
Wdym "how does this happen"?? I'm confused by what you mean
[An0nymous_777]: Wdym "how does this happen"?? I'm confused by what you mean
[jfnux]: I agree, but what if you have mental illness trauma specifically from mental illness, would that still count?
[Mukoki]: Okay?
[Actualsaint333]: You’re 17. Go see a therapist before trying to place all of your frustration on a generation as a whole.
[Artistic-Bid-482]: Cry harder
??
[An0nymous_777]: ??
[Sea-Cicada8426]: You don’t get to decide, at 17, who the “real suffers” are. Or 
what anxiety actually is. Or OCD. Or PTSD. Or ADHD. Your trauma is not 
superior to others trauma. You have every right to be angry for the 
horrible things that you went through, but your anger is directed in the
 wrong direction. Let people be. Maybe these people are happy to finally
 feel like they’re not alone. Imagine spending your entire life living 
with something like autism but never having a diagnosis so your entire 
life you thought you were crazy or weird or whatever  for feeling so 
different. And now you don’t have to feel alone because others shared 
their experiences and story. So now you share because maybe you too, can
 help someone feel less alone.  The idea that others trauma or diagnosis
 are not real because you decide so is what is making you angry.
Also- I truly am so sorry you went through something so horrific. I
 am not in any way diminishing that. That is truly heartbreaking to 
read. I should have said that first.

--- DOCUMENTO: Getting this off my chest _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: Getting this off my chest : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I don’t know how many times this has been posted or discussed on 
this sub, but I just wanted to share my opinion as a 20-year-old in 
college who was diagnosed with depression and anxiety recently.
First, I’m not saying that college is a waste of time or a scam. 
However, I do believe that a lot of high schools, and the education 
system in general, don’t properly prepare students for college. I grew 
up right when COVID hit, so my first year of high school, 9th grade, was
 cut short after just three months. After that, 10th and 11th grade were
 a mix of online and in-person learning, which made everything feel 
inconsistent and unstructured. By 12th grade, it felt like schools just 
wanted to push students through. I saw kids with failing grades graduate
 simply because they wanted us out.
Then college hit, and I realized how unprepared I was. Now, as a 
junior, I feel like I’ve barely learned anything from my actual classes.
 Almost everything I know has come from self-education, reading books, 
researching topics online, and using AI to help with things I don’t 
understand. College hasn’t really taught me much, especially for my 
major.
Speaking of which, I’m a writing major. Since I was a kid, my 
dream has been to write fiction, whether that was manga, comics, or 
novels. During COVID, I fell in love with books and realized that 
storytelling is what I want to do. But college hasn’t given me any real 
guidance on how to pursue this as a career. Everything I’ve learned 
about writing and publishing has come from my own research, not from my 
classes. And I know I’m not the only one who feels this way.
That’s why I truly believe that unless your major is something 
like medicine or law, college doesn’t always guarantee success. You go 
into debt, and you’re not even promised a job when you graduate. And 
finding a job in general right now is brutal, especially if you come 
from a low-income background like I do.
I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this, so I just wanted
 to share my thoughts. If someone from another generation is reading 
this, I’d say don’t just listen to what everyone says about college, 
really think about what you want to do in the long run. Burnout is real,
 but at this point, I’m already too deep in, so I might as well finish 
and get my degree.
I just wanted to get this off my chest. If you made it this far, I hope you have a great day.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[SilkyDymia]: I can relate, I felt I haven’t learned much from my degree either. Trying to just get it done at this point.
I’ve found that most of the stuff you learn in life isn’t from college, more from real world experiences like you said.
Do you have the opportunity to maybe take a break or take a semester off? A break could help you de-stress a little bit.
Unfortunately, I can’t take a break. It’s just not beneficial for 
me. I mean, I’m already struggling with all the costs and the books. 
And, you know, my job is cutting hours. And, you know, being in low 
class, poor class, however they want to identify us is hard. I mean, it 
feels like we get no support at all from the government, from this 
state, whatever it is. I’m not that educated on news and what goes on in
 the world. I just know it’s terrible what’s going on. And it just feels
 like we’re in a never-ending losing battle. We can’t escape it. I’m 
sorry that you’re not learning anything about your major. I understand 
how frustrating it is. Sometimes it can feel like a waste of time.

[Equivalent_Reason_27]: Hey man,
First off take a deep breath. You’re not alone buddy. I didn’t go to college but i feel you.
If you need people to talk with join the discord :]
I appreciate it thanks
Of course dude. Sometimes you gotta take it day by day, sometimes minute by minute but you can do it
Thanks, I try. I also have a whole other plethora of things I 
stress that I can’t control. You know, like a World War III, and 
especially I think a big one a lot of people have, death. But, you know,
 I appreciate you taking the time to respond. It means a lot
I get you man. The way things are right now it feels rough. But 
again I want to emphasize you’re not alone, and you’re not lesser than 
anyone because you needed to get it off your chest.
If you’ve got loved ones, try to talk to them as hard as it is.
And I never would want to push it on anyone, but religion and my faith has helped me with these anxieties and stresses.
Oh yeah, I do believe in a religion, in a faith. I believe in 
Jesus Christ, the Savior, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Three in 
one. The same but different. It’s just I’ve been having a little bit of 
faith problems. Um, and especially what’s going on in the world. I’m not
 the smartest when it comes to upon taking new stuff, but for someone 
who’s already in old class, you know, poor class, you know, it’s hard. 
Especially when you’re looking for opportunities and you don’t get them.
 Especially when it comes to job opportunities have been terrible.

[Intrepid_Passage_692]: Since you’ll have 2 years left I’ll suggest a few things
You don’t have to finish your degree if you don’t want to. I would
 highly recommend, like, it is necessary you for internships to atleast 
get SOMETHING out of college. If you like it thug it out, what’s the 
worst that happens? You landed a job you like?
Transfer to a different program or some trade adjacent community 
college (like electromech or hvac (basic I know). If you’re fairly smart
 and in shape I would highly recommend you go into automotive. Back home
 I was making ~500 bucks on weekends doing odd jobs for people because 
my dad told them I work on cars for a living. Also an amazing networking
 tool if people like what you do, it’s how I’m where I am today. Only

Idk why the 3 is formatted weird but what you put in is what you 
get out. You have to be proactive in college, high paying jobs aren’t 
gonna be given to you just because you have a piece of paper
[JGCities]: Some tough love friend - writing is awesome, wish I did more of 
it. But its a hard career field and not actually something you need a 
degree for, you ever look at the education of your favorite writer 
before buying their book? Now it is a good degree if you want to teach 
English, and there is always a demand for English teachers. Stephen 
King's first job was an English teacher.
I think college is best when it is focused on degrees that are 
needed before you can get the job. You want to be a Human resources 
manager you need an HR degree. Want to work in marketing you need a 
marketing degree. Finance, accounting, etc etc all need a degree in that
 field for you to get good jobs.
So I would suggest you do some soul searching on what do I want to
 do with my life if I can't be a writer and look at adding that as a 
minor or second major.
BTW one thing you probably could do with writing degree is get 
into tech writing, good money. Do some research and check it out. 
Certainly not exciting, but paying bills is a good thing. My brother's 
father inlaw did that for Gulfstream. They would hand him the specs for a
 new plane and he would put together an operations manual for it. 
Glorified cut and paste. Average pay for that job is around $60k though,
 paying the bills is a good thing.

So basically I'm 18M and I recently graduated from High School, 
and I'm planning on getting a job soon. The main thing that held me back
 from getting a job sooner is the burnout from school, but also a 
constant feeling of social anxiety. I've always been horrible at 
socializing, I grew up in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere as an only 
child, and never had the opportunity to socially acclimate myself with 
anyone besides older individuals. I went through high school with my 
small group of childhood friends (I barely saw them because of 
mismatched schedules), but I never really made new friendships through 
the entire experience. I never really fit into any cliques or groups. I 
wasn't popular by any stretch of the imagination, but I also didn't fit 
into the weird band kid group either, I was somewhat in the awkward 
middle ground. I'm getting off topic, my point is that I have a very 
difficult time forming lasting friendships with other people, and I 
don't know why. Whenever I get into a conversation with someone, it's 
usually a pleasant and civil interaction, but then after that they are 
seemingly disinterested in ever speaking to me again. This happened on 
the last day of school. Some kid in my gym class approached me, and we 
shot the shit for a while, the conversation was actually pretty 
enjoyable. I asked for his snap, and he said he didn't have one (he 
lied, I found it like a week later). So he gave me his phone number, and
 ghosted me nearly immediately. I have no idea if it's a me problem or 
not, but I have absolutely no idea how to make lasting friendships 
outside of the ones I already have. I always thought that it might be 
that I am out of touch with my peers, I have very little in common with 
the classmates I have spoken to. While they are often chill, the 
conversations usually don't go anywhere because of the lack of common 
ground. On the other side of the coin, my parents paint me as a stoic, 
dismissive individual, and that I'm the one that is disinterested in the
 conversation. I believe that may be a little overdramatic, but I have 
entertained the thought. I don't understand where I'm going wrong, I've 
tried to be friendly but for some reason the other person is just not 
interested in continuing the conversation with me. The main point is, 
how exactly do yall easily make friends? While I'm content with my main 
group of friends, I just really need to start reaching out more, I came 
to the realization that it isn't healthy to stay cooped up in the house 
for the entire summer lol
TLDR: I have shitty social skills, am unpopular, and want to know 
strategies on how to carry a conversation/make friends easier
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[minetf]: Can you get a therapist? It could be normal problems with finding 
people ready and open to new friendships as an adult or it could be your
 communication skills. It's hard to guess over the internet. A therapist
 can give you more direct feedback.
If you can't afford a therapist, maybe look up toastmasters clubs 
near you or online. They will be full of older people but maybe that 
will take the pressure off a little bc you won't expect to find your 
best friends (although you might). It's just a space to practice 
conversation and public speaking and get feedback.
[Buns-n-stuff]: I’m gonna be real, I’m in the same boat. I went to private school 
most of my life, knew the same 20 people until I got to high school 
because I wanted to switch to public school. I had zero friends when I 
graduated in 2020, and I got lucky to meet my group. We actually met at a
 furry convention, weird spot I know, but I got invited to their room, 
we smoked weed, played smash bros and I got all their numbers and we 
hang out almost every day and have since 2022. It’s a lot of luck and 
honestly just putting yourself out there. To work on conversation skills
 I for real used some AI programs. Don’t get weird with them and see 
these programs as real people though, just try to have conversations 
with it about something like your favorite movie, favorite place to eat,
 basic conversations to get the idea of talking to be a little less 
scary. Just get out there, try your best to talk, find your niche and 
you’ll eventually find friends

recently turned 20(F), for a lot of my life I’ve struggled with 
depression but recently it’s really bad. I see no end in sight. I’m 
stressed all the time, everything is expensive, I’m broke. I hate my 
minimum wage job but can’t get hired anywhere else. Can’t find an 
internship anywhere, I have to watch my mom break down about bills every
 month and I can’t help her as much as I want to. People don’t believe 
in climate change which is destroying us. I’m severely burnt out and 
have no energy to do anything but sleep lately. My body hurts and I 
don’t see the future turning around. People are becoming so hateful, you
 could walk outside and be killed because you were there at the wrong 
time.
Things weren’t like this before, I’m so sad. I feel like lately 
I’ve stopped making goals for myself because I don’t see a point 
anymore. I’m having a hard time even completing one class a semester. 
Everything is catching up to me, I don’t do anything anymore but lay in 
bed. Most days I’m too tired to even pick up my phone. The days are 
going by so fast too. I’m 20 now but it seems like just last year I 
turned 16. I want to go back so bad, I feel lost.
Edit: I think what’s really not helping either is seeing my mom 
still struggling so badly at 47 years old. Everyday, she hauls herself 
up for work, she’s exhausted and her job pays her unfairly. We barely 
make ends meet for rent, living paycheck to paycheck. I know it’s up to 
me to turn my life around but it seems so unrealistic some days.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[petitecrivain]: First of all I should say I'm sorry you're going through this. 
Nobody deserves that burden. From a mental health perspective however, 
this is treatable. Depression treatment via talk therapy or medication 
can't remove life stressors but it can definitely give you tools to work
 through them. I've seen people transform in weeks or months. They went 
from bedrotting 12+ hours a day to being fully functional. I'd advise 
you to get evaluated and seek treatment.
The broader context definitely seems like a factor though. People 
seem reluctant to discuss social and economic determinants of health and
 wellness in Western countries, even as we count hundreds of thousands 
of deaths of despair. I think the issue isn't just material poverty but 
the burnout and stress inherent to working life in an era where luxuries
 are cheap, essentials are expensive, and cluttered schedules and 
technology break down social interactions, relationships, and 
solidarity. The assault on human rights and growing authoritarianism 
definitely don't help.
I can't presume to know your circumstances or opportunities but I 
can guess that someone cares about you and that you have something to 
contribute that'll make someone's day brighter. This life can be worth 
living, and there's likely a way out of your situation, even though you 
may not see it.
[zehahun]: hai diva, I get how you feel life right now is really hard. 
everything feels heavy, expensive, and unfair, and it’s easy to lose 
hope when you’re doing your best but nothing seems to work out 
especially when someone out there who didn't even struggle much and 
already has a extravagant lifestyle. you’re not weak for feeling tired 
or unmotivated, it just means you’ve been strong for too long, it's 
normal to feel like this, give your body some rest bby <3.
it’s okay to rest, cry, and not have everything figured out. you 
don’t need to have your whole future planned, you're still young AND yet
 to enjoy your 20s.
things will change, even when it doesn’t feel like they will. 
you’ve made it through every bad day so far, and that takes real 
strength that makes you a strong baddie. you’re still here, and that 
matters. try engaging yourself into a hobby whenever the thoughts are 
being mean to you.
you got this love, don't give up yet. im rooting for you. 🥹🫶🏻💕
This means a lot to me. Sometimes when I’m so in my head, it seems
 like nothing anyone says to me can make me feel better but this does. 
Thank you!
im glad it made you feel better! like I said, I'll always root for
 you, doesn't matter whether I'm next to you or not, my prayers are with
 you. think of me as a younger sister who you've to become a role model 
for, hustle in life and get that bag you deserve. whenever you feel 
suffocated, sit down and relax you're being too harsh on yourself for 
someone who just turned 20. I know you've responsibilities but without a

[[deleted]]: The way to end depression is to stop "socializing" online and make
 at least one close friend in real life. Someone you can share these 
things with. I know that may not be easy, but it's pretty much the only 
way out.
Nah deadass like I’ve been getting out doing more activities + 
being more social in the last few months than I ever have in my life. 
Still aware of what’s going on, but it’s not the only thing I’m focusing
 on now. Gotta show yourself it’s still good and joy out there in 
whatever you choose
I mean… easier said than done when you barely have the energy to shower, let alone socialize.

[inhaledpie4]: You sound very burnt out. Do you have friends that can support 
you, take you out for coffee, or something? I am an introvert but I 
can't overstate the importance of finding at least one person who fills 
your cup when you see them in person, meeting with them at least twice a
 month if you can (optimally once a week).
Two acts of self care and doing at least one thing a day for enjoyment (it helps if it's fun) has helped me immensely.
I think I’ve been burnt out for a few years. And as for friends, I
 do, actually. My best friend, I love her. She’s away at college. She 
lives on campus a few hours away, so we only see each other once every 
few months. I saw her last weekend, actually which helped but I don’t 
know. We talk about these things often, and I love her to death but she 
comes from a very well off family. We don’t really come from the same 
world and I have no resentment towards her about it whatsoever but she 
doesn’t know how to respond to these things sometimes. I feel a bit more
 comfortable talking to people who know what it’s like even if it’s on 
here.
Sometimes having people and friends around you doesn't necessarily
 mean you have to share about struggles, it can be a chance to feel free
 from certain troubles

[Overthinking_babes]: This is so relatable it hurts lol
[Cosmic_alien20]: Honestly it's the same everywhere. In my country, unemployment is a
 big thing with skyrocketing real estate prices. Everything is expensive
 nowadays, the negativity everywhere from news online to real life; 
sometimes I also wonder, "did all of us young generation people deserve 
this?"
But hey, only we can change our life. Tune in for new hobbies and 
new skills, and stop caring about what society thinks. I also read 
philosophy book from time to time and they have helped me quite a lot.
I hear you. I’ve been trying to pick up a hobby but I lose 
motivation so easily, I always drop it after a few months. I’m so 
disappointed in myself but I literally have lost interest in everything I
 used to love. It’s weird, I hope I get that back soon
That's because of a digital pacifier that is more appealing. Have you considered deleting social media?

[DrDrago-4]: I just learned this strategy the last few weeks, so I cant vouch really strongly
but so far I've had success, just saying fuck you to social 
anxiety. see a cool guy I want to talk to doing something I enjoy like 
disc golf ? ask to join the group
see a cute girl ? shoot that shot.
miss the homies? call em after work hours, theyre tired. youre tired. but talking is easy
its reached the point for me, the worst case scenario is doing 
nothing. honestly cant fuck up worse so, throwing darts.. why not ig
not even 22 but I see the appeal now, of like not this. idk so far
 most of my age range feels the same, we are all fucked and everyone's 
just been like not even thinking about it.
started when I made a Minecraft server for my homies, we played a 
few hours each weekend. now we talk 2hrs+ each night even if we aren't 
gaming. ive expanded that attitude, yk nothing will come to you unless 
you make it happen. time will tell, but im meeting new people again and 
its working so far
and as far as goals go, meh well. live your best life with what 
you got. might suck but try and enjoy the suck, put some effort into 
changing it. cant do 100% in a day, its the small shit that stacks up. 
sounds like self-help propaganda but that ones real, just try and be 1% 
better at xyz each day. itll happen before you know it
[Fuzea]: I just keep pushing and trying to be better than I was last year. I
 set measurable, realistic goals for myself. I exercise every day. I 
take a lot of risks with the understanding that failure is not the end 
of the world, as long as I’m alive I can always keep trying.
We only get one life. I don’t think there’s anything waiting for 
us after death, this is it, this is all we get. Might as well make the 
most of it.
You say you can barely do one class a semester, fuck it, push 
yourself and do two. If you fail at least you tried. Take another two 
and try again. A little resilience will take you very far. You should be
 more afraid of regret than of failure.

[SirThinkAllThings]: Counseling, and perhaps a psychiatrist follow up.  Sounds like you
 may have depression, but meds such as setraline and talk therapy or 
cognitive therapy may help alongside.  Prayers your way.
[Sea_Nautilus]: I feel the same as you much of the time. I think the fear from 
Covid and the political climate in the world right now is contributing 
to this.
I think there was a study done that showed that money does 
increase happiness up to the point where people were secure and weren’t 
actively worrying about finances. After that, larger amounts of money do
 not increase happiness.
I believe our governments have a responsibility to ensure every 
person is “secure” in that they are not worrying every day about 
surviving. That means some combination of livable wages, free 
healthcare, free education, subsidized housing, etc. We probably don’t 
need so many “handouts” if we just have livable wages.
Since you personally can’t really do anything about that, I think the next best solution is community.
Never in history has a 20 year old or even a 47 year old been 
expected to support themselves or anyone else on their own. Yet for some
 reason it’s expected in modern times.
Building a community means you pool resources. You provide and 
accept help. If your car breaks down, a friend drives you to your 
doctors’ appointment, and you can carpool to work with a coworker. You 
can’t afford new furniture, but you can offer to take your neighbors’ 
old couch off their hands. If you can’t afford rent, maybe you have 
someone who would let you crash on their couch.
Community is about safety. When you have people you can rely on, 
it gives you the safety net that you cannot achieve through wages alone.
Building a community in these days is becoming harder and harder. I
 don’t know the specifics about your life, so it’s hard to give real 
advice, but you could even try asking ChatGPT: “How can I build a 
community around me and my mom to help us feel more secure when times 
are difficult? Ask me any questions that could help you provide advice.”
General advice is to just be more aware of the people in your 
life, especially the ones who may be more open to company. Many places 
have meetup groups for this purpose. You can start there and see what 
you think. It’s easiest to make friends with people you see often, so 
finding free classes (check your local library for things like this!) or
 volunteering somewhere (just for an hour a week or something) could be a
 place to start and a convenient way to find people with similar 
interests.  As an example, joining a dungeons and dragons group (can be 
virtual) is a way to ensure you spend time with the same people on a 
regular basis, and it’s a quick way to bond quickly with people.

get a higher paying job for months. I guess I'd say sheer luck, lots of 
praying, holding on to friends and family, and appreciating the little 
things.

are right now. that’s the problem with our economic order. it’s all 
about the individual and it’s their fault if they don’t win in a system 
where it’s impossible to win. the best thing you can do is realize this 
and let yourself take a break from the mental stress of trying to change
 everything yourself. build community and try to focus on building a 
strong internal and spiritual life. everything else is bs & will 
never work in a system that is designed to fuck us over

[Special_EDy]: Your mom probably isnt a healthy person for you to be living with.
 It sounds like she has depression and anxiety issues, which you would 
be genetically prone to inherit those tendencies, and her mood is 
affecting you. Im not saying anything else about either of yall, or that
 theres anything wrong with what either of yall are going through, just 
that "misery loves company". If you are mentally struggling, the worst 
thing you can do is surround yourself with people who reinforce that 
mindset.
As for having a bleak outlook, that is entirely within your 
control even though I hear you feel powerless against the machine of 
politics and economics. These are things which are affecting you 
mentally, and that mental anguish is affecting your physical health, but
 none of these things have any direct impact on your well-being besides 
making you depressed.
Climate change isnt something worth losing sleep over, its not 
something that will happen in our lifetimes. I dont think there's 
actually anyone who thinks that it is good to be pumping exhaust fumes 
and other wastes into the atmosphere. However, it's not like your life 
has been directly impacted by climate change, or ever will be. The time 
it takes coastlines to move or environments to shift will take 
generations, cities will move and life will adapt. We've survived 
asteroids, ice ages, oxygen levels so high they nearly sterilized the 
planet, etc. Im not trying to make a case that you shouldn't be 
concerned or that we shouldn't take steps to mitigate climate change, I 
just want to make it clear that it would be unhealthy for you to let 
this negativity impact your life by getting depressed.
There are lots of nice people in the world. Even more importance 
than how we treat each other, is how you feel about it. If I am in a bad
 mood, depressed or anxious, Im going to have a bad day and other people
 are going to make it worse. If I am feeling good and having a great 
day, those same people and same interactions are going to make my day 
better. The world just sort of is what it is, and its up to you to 
decide if thats good or bad. You will see the world the way you want to 
see it, and not being in the right headspace is going to make it 
disastrous.

[Wxskater]: Its about balance. I had to learn this too. My hobby became my 
career. When you transition from hobby to job you have to learn to 
separate it a bit. Like in college and before i started working i could 
watch pretty much any severe event in the country lol. Now dont count on
 it unless its personally impacting me or if its a really high end 
event. Like i watched the bimodal high risk day right after rolling fork
[WildKarrdesEmporium]: I was burnt out for several months, then I got laid off. At least I'm not burnt out anymore.

[CheckMateFluff]: I found out quickly people are more than willing to take whatever I
 am willing to give, but hardly ever give back at that same level, so I 
just do the bare minimum now, unless incentivized to do more, or I am 
helping someone of my own free will.
[This_Pie5301]: Time to fix that then, we are young and have time
Yup absolutely, some serious work is in order. It’s like I treated
 life as a series of checkpoints rather than an experience to be had
That makes two of us, time to actually try enjoying life for a bit
 rather than trying to figure everything out (nobody has it all figured 
out)

Not to sound emo but this is truly what type of mindset I've been 
in for the last few years. When Covid hit I was a freshman in high 
school who had high expectations, I wanted to get into an Ivy League 
school and do a sport. But then online school hit, and combined with 
undiagnosed ADHD I basically flunked half my classes for the year and 
had to take summer classes. It was hard to take because I was a 
straight-A student who never failed a class before. I felt like I failed
 my purpose (immigrant parents didn't help lol). Then we went back 
outside and everyone basically acted like nothing happened. But 
something changed within me, even though my grades were better than 
ever, I felt like there wasn't a point to studying something I'm 
passionate about, because nothing I was passionate about made enough 
money, nothing is affordable, I'll never be able to buy a house, etc. I 
went from wanting to make a great living, to just wanting to make a 
regular living, to  just wanting to get by. Reality had hit me and I 
started focusing on saving money instead. My sophomore year grades were 
horrible, so I got my associate's degree from a community college  and 
I'm going to be commuting to a regular state school. The reason I'm here
 now is because I decided to stalk some of my old classmates online. 
Their lives couldn't be more different from mine-going to top colleges, 
partying, getting internships, getting scholarships from playing sports,
 leading clubs, etc. While I was busy coasting by, they kept their 
grades up and actually got involved. It made me feel like shit because I
 felt like I wasn't aiming high enough. I know I'm capable of more, I 
just have the shit work ethic that I've had my entire life. I've had so 
many projects in the past that just crashed and burned due to my own 
self-sabotaging. One time I organised an online magazine with a few 
girls and just completely ghosted everyone from burnout. Over the years I
 just stopped trying because I couldn't trust myself to stick to 
anything. Right now, my only motivation is being able to move out with 
my current boyfriend in the future. Other than that, it's a daily 
struggle to care about anything I'm learning in college. I'm scared that
 if I continue down this path I'll just get stuck coasting by rather 
than developing as a person. I want to get better, but it feels like a 
losing battle.

[[deleted]]: People will go in various directions in life. Peaking too early 
can be a bad thing. The most important thing is that you should live to 
make yourself happy. You mentioned immigrant parents, and I’m guessing 
they have had some influence on you that led you to this outlook. 
Immigrant parents are typically full of high expectations and put a lot 
of pressure on their kids. I know from experience. Just know that you 
can live a life on your terms and not a life that will make them happy.
[Mannersmakethman2]: Are you me? This is terrifyingly accurate to how this decade has 
turned out for me so far (except for the "having a boyfriend" part; I’ve
 never even been a part of a friend group).
[BernoullisQuaver]: Eh. Some people just fall thru the cracks. You can work your ass 
off and do everything right, but you get hit by one piece of bad luck, 
or don't get the lucky break you needed, and congrats, you win a life of
 obscure poverty.
I'd say, own the coasting. Society didn't hold up its end of the 
bargain for you, so do just enough to get by and no more. And with your 
remaining time and energy, build yourself up. Sleep all you want. Work 
out. Find some friends you can spend time with. Take up a hobby that 
doesn't cost much. You can still develop as a person after you drop out 
of the rat race.

i see it everyday on the internet, like its to late to have fun, 
to start a college degree, to date, to be successful, to travel, to 
start over, like if it is the cutaway age to do things. Honestly i think
 we're the first people to not consider 30, 35 or 40 to be insecure 
about this like previous generations but shit like this is why everyone 
is so depressed and we are having people with burnouts in their early 
20s, ngl is honestly so stupid, like maybe some zoomers say it is a joke
 but theres a large majority that says this unironically and its 
honestly just sad, this why we are miserable gang.

[ninafinabobina]: Same, I think more and more people in our generation are off put 
by the idea of a classic, American-dream like home. I don't think I know
 a single Gen Z/Zellenial with a proper house. Most live in vans, 
schoolbuses, apartments. Renting at 30.
I know one couple that bought a house and it was like $450k and 
they gotta redo a lot of it. And it’s way out in nowhere. The bones of 
the house are pretty good tho.
Another thing is, I feel I’d get sick of spending lots of time 
cutting grass, weeding, edging, leave raking, snow blowing, planting, 
cleaning gutters, etc… it’s a huge time sink.

[cosmic-kats]: Can agree. 26 here and I’m just kinda done caring about aging. I’m
 gonna embrace my bitter old lady years before I need to.
[[deleted]]: About to be 35 myself (idk why this sub got recommended but here I
 am), 26 was the year for me too. Idk what it was, but as soon as I hit 
26 something shifted. A sort of post nut clarity for life. Really great 
feeling, that.
I could carbon copy your comment word for word. Also 35 and there 
was something about 26. It’s weird to remember that now because now 26 
sounds soo young. But there really was a shift.
I remember being a kid around 14, and my uncle who is hilariously 
pessimistic about everything said that as his daughter was turning 26 it
 was ‘all down hill from here’ 😂. I was super confused because even at 
my young age I though 26 was still way too young to be in any way ‘old’.
 I thought maybe 30, but 26 was completely absurd, and I thought it was 
just my uncle being his usual self. But his comment stuck with me. Then,
 when I was 26 Igot it. Not that it’s ’downhill’ lol because 
that’s ridiculous, it’s still young especially by today’s standards. But
 you are definitely grown up all of a sudden. You have an understanding 
of how quickly time can go and how people are still very much themselves
 even as they age. I really understood for the first time that when I’m 
80 I will still very much bemeand not some abstract old person.

youth, and basically you all live and breath this awful hopeless

[Lil_Kibble_Vert]: Youth is a mentality. Some people lose it sooner than others.
I know guys who are 35+, that I rave with, that say this is some 
of the best memories they’ve made in their life. It’s all about how you 
look at the world.
Some people do have to grow up sooner than others though, and 
that’s probably where that thought comes from. But life never truly ends
 until you don’t wake up anymore.
It is absolutely a mentality!  Even at 38 I don't feel like a grown up 😆

I'm 34 year old woman. I used to think "life will end at X 
milestone", but honestly that all changed when I realized at 26 that 
having kids is a choice and not something peoplehave todo.  I
 have almost all the same hobbies I had at 20, and I get to enjoy them 
more fully now. I play more video games than I ever have beforee. I love
 anime. I stay up crazy late on weekends and sleep in to my heart's 
content. The older I get, the more sure I am that being childfree is the
 right choice for me.
Not saying nobody should have kids... But that it's probably the 
most impactful decision someone can possibly make, in terms of the 
future course of our lives - and there are no takebacksies.
Same age here. I was always told once I get older and hit my 30s, 
I'll want to have kids and settle down. I've never been MORE sure in my 
entire life I don't want kids! 😂
I don't see that changing any time soon either...
35 still go to concerts, but also like to go to bed early on non concert days :)
My dad said his 40s and 50s were the best years of his life, and he lived it uphardin his 20s and 30s as well. He’s in his 60s now and still having fun 
every day. Age is just a number. Redditors need to chill. Looking back, 
being 16 years old sucked. I had fun, but damn was I dumb.

I hang out pretty regularly with a couple people in their 
thirties, and that makes me realize that the deadline of like “old at 
30” isn’t true. I know a couple people around 34/35 and I forget that 
they’re not in their twenties because they don’t look or act any 
different.

I think some people just live life incorrectly and put emphasis on
 dumb stuff. Most people are also dumb so it makes sense ig…
Idk, I also just Can’t understand how people Can’t see the 
absolute beauty of life and the earth. This is all incredible. I also 
was born and grew up among the worst condition’s imaginable besides a 
bad family, they were amazing. So I guess I am much more grateful too.

[[deleted]]: Me too! This obsession with youth has gotten way too far. I turned
 22 a little over a month ago, and it was so upsetting to me. 22 is 
still young. I shouldn’t feel this way, and I know that, but it’s so 
hard to not internalize what you’re constantly bombarded with.
honestly it's not aging that worries me, it's just incredibly 
disorienting seeing myself as an adult when i've always, for quite a 
while, knew myself as "the kid" or "the teen" who'd live and die that 
young. it's kind of stupid since age shouldnt determine personality, but
 yeah.
it's just kinda disappointing since being an adult just 
feels...worthless? i guess maybe it's because i never really had any 
enjoyable childhood to look back fondly on but it really does give this 
incredible loneliness feeling knowing that i'm not really "young and 
stupid" anymore.
i don't know. it's really weird. i say this as someone who just turned 20 this month.
I’n ngl, turning 20 really fucked with me. Something about no 
longer have “teen” in my age just make it sort of hit me that I’m really
 an adult now. I think I also liked having the excuse of being “young 
and dumb”, and now that I’m getting older, I just feel behind in life.
Maybe get away from social media for a bit. You shouldn't feel 
like this because age is happening to everyone. You're 22 now but 32 
will come fast. Just gotta enjoy the ride.

[grand-salvaging20]: I've seen these types of posts, and it's not just Zoomers who 
"dread" over turning 25. Some of our older peers are dreading (or have 
dreaded) about turning 25 for the same reasons, and honestly it's 
tiring.
Ironically, I find that the young adults who mope about this 
actually are one of the reasons why being 25 is so stigmatized. Don't 
want to see 25 as the end of the world? Stop talking like it's the end 
of the world. It's that simple, peeps.
I'm an old just lurking by, but 25 is was only stigmatized by your
 generation. My generation (millennials) definitely felt anxious about 
thirty, but 25 did not cross our minds. It's entirely a Gen Z invention.
Millennial here as well. Can confirm this, we definitely didn’t 
see 25 as old. We thought we had all the time in the world to grow up 
and  “acting our age” was for later.
World has changed tho
I can understand why Gen-Z’s do feel this pressure to be 
successful so early in life. Cost of living these days is insane. You 
can’t just work a regular job (or 2 jobs even) and expect to afford a 
house, ever!! If you don’t have mom and daddy’s money to help you then 
you better be some elite entrepreneur by the age of 22 or you shit outta
 luck
Plus all the pressure from social media influencers making success sound so easy
Peter pan generation.
And for GenX was more about the 35-40s. Will the next gen feel afraid about 18s?
Anyone turning 25 soon is a zoomer. The youngest millennial is 27. So what older peers are you referring to?
I meant those born around the late 90s, those who are in the 
"grey" area of being either considered a zoomer or a millennial.
for me it’s more like stuff you feel pressure you can’t do at a 
certain age. oh you wanna dress like that? well you can’t because you’re
 too old. oh you’re acting that way well you’re too old to act like that
 (within reason). oh you watch that and do that at that age? aren’t you 
too old to do that? - it’s restricting of freedom and in all honesty 
it’s bullshit age shouldn’t have to define your interests and actions

I meant those born around the late 90s, those who are in the 
"grey" area of being either considered a zoomer or a millennial.
[grand-salvaging20]: I meant those born around the late 90s, those who are in the

[w4stedbucket]: for me it’s more like stuff you feel pressure you can’t do at a 
certain age. oh you wanna dress like that? well you can’t because you’re
 too old. oh you’re acting that way well you’re too old to act like that
 (within reason). oh you watch that and do that at that age? aren’t you 
too old to do that? - it’s restricting of freedom and in all honesty 
it’s bullshit age shouldn’t have to define your interests and actions
[johngwen91]: As 29 yo dude. Life is fucking awesome atm
[Flat_Transition_3775]: I’m 26 and I’m starting college next year!
best of luck bro 👊
[xcywji45]: best of luck bro 👊
[Old_Consequence2203]: Exactly, same thoughts! That's why I STILL consider 25 to be young-adults, because they're stillyoung! You still have a whole life ahead of you & a lot to look forward to.
[OtterlyFoxy]: My brother is 25 and he laughs at Skibidi Toilet. It’s still quite young
Am 25 i thought skibidi toilet was pretty funny like as quick thing it just got old fast with too much lore.
[shangumdee]: Am 25 i thought skibidi toilet was pretty funny like as quick thing it just got old fast with too much lore.

because alot of people these days are living longer so enjoy it.
I don’t even look barely different from when I was 18 😭

[RunChariotRun]: Millennial here. I remember feeling (without knowing why) like my 
life would essentially be over at 30.  I knew a bunch of other 
millennials who felt similarly. I didn’t think that I would die. I 
didn’t have that kind of climate or political crisis awareness. But, I 
had this weird feeling like life just wouldn’t be mine anymore.
It was the opposite. I actually felt liberated. For some reason, I
 was stuck on the numbers, but I think really what I should have been 
focusing on was my resources. That was about how long it took me to pay 
off loans, get some work experience, and build up enough of a savings 
account to feel like I was taking care of myself and starting to be able
 to make life decisions the way I wanted to.
I think it was really about autonomy.
Same.  Only real difference between 21 and 31 yo me is I can 
actually afford what I want to do now and live life on my terms how I 
want.  Plus much more confident with the vast majority of my 
insecurities totally gone.  Life is good.
[shadowcat999]: Same.  Only real difference between 21 and 31 yo me is I can

[Agent_Giraffe]: I’m turning 25 in January. Since 1 year ago I’ve: gotten a job, 
gotten a car, saved $20k, went to Italy+Oktoberfest, went to a bunch of 
car shows and races, went out to see some edm artists, gone 
skiing/golfing and done lots and lots of cooking. 70 years to go…
[madseason238]: That's because it's a chronically online take. Most people in real
 life consider 25 to be extremely young and see a 23 year old and a 25 
year old more or less the same way.
Teenagers are rampant on the internet and they are scared to even 
turn 20. They popularized this view because they spew it everywhere. 23 
is already bordering on geriatric for them. They don't navigate time the
 same way an adult does.
[thereslcjg2000]: I’ve literally never met one person in real life who openly displays that mindset. Make of that what you will.
[maybimnotreal]: Nah I'm 26 my youth has been sucked out of me and I am a tired old
 gremlin living under your nearest and nastiest underpass lmao jk just 
in case
[[deleted]]: when i was young i didn’t think i’d make it past 18. three years 
later and i’m doing the best i’ve ever done. cheers to another 60!
[intjdad]: Yeah Gen Z is emotionally fucked due to this, I'm guessing we'll 
see a lot of suicides as Gen Z moves into their 30s if something doesn't
 change fast.
The truth is that you're a "young adult" until your 40s. Then you're just a normal adult
[[deleted]]: i’m 24 and i think right now my life is the calmest and best it’s 
ever been so far. i anticipate that it’ll only (hopefully) go up from 
here. i look forward to the future
[Rough-Tension]: Dude idk how else I could forecast my future the way it’s turned 
out. I’m in law school rn, 23, and severely inexperienced with dating. 
I’ve had one gf. When I graduate in 2 years, I will be working like 
there’s fire under my ass, bc there is. The fire of $150k in debt and a 
bank chomping at the bits to get my money. I will be busy as hell, 
broke, and stressed at 25. When am I supposed to date? Red flags start 
flying like I’m the fucking CCP past 25 my guy. Clock is ticking
If you think about that way you'll always feel rushed and time 
will fly. Just enjoy the ride and try to add in social activities 
outside of work.
[Doowap_Diddy]: If you think about that way you'll always feel rushed and time 
will fly. Just enjoy the ride and try to add in social activities

[deadmemesdeaderdream]: i dreaded turning 23 now i can’t wait to be 24 and graduate college
[14Calypso]: I'm 25, and honestly it's just great not giving any fucks about 
what people think anymore. There's no high school or college where I 
have to interact with the same people every day. My work is chill and 
professional. And I can see whoever I want to see after work. I'm happy 
with my life and I'd trade very little.
I do still relate better to people younger than me (my best friend
 is 19), but I can finally get along with basically everyone.
[Dreamo84]: As I understand it, around 35 is when our body just decides it's 
done and starts falling apart. I'm 39 and I feel like I can confirm 
this... lol
[OkAssignment6163]: I'm 40. I still have some time. You young'in are good.
[m033118b]: I just turned 25 in August but I feel more adulting has to happen.
 I’m paying my bills and living with my bf of 5 1/2 years happily, but I
 want more? Idk how to explain it. But for once in my life I will say 
that I can see my plan coming together and it’s working in my favor. If I
 keep this up, by 26 I’ll be golden.
[[deleted]]: Imo the tutorial mode of life ends when you have a child.
[Ugly1998]: I just turned 25 and hate life so I can see why they want to end 
it. The feeling that your best years were just wasted to trauma and 
being treated like shit.
[Fun-Track-3044]: 25?  Barely out of diapers. Life begins at 25. You finally have a 
little money, might be out of grad school by then, developed a little 
credibility at work.
[Ambitious_Work_3837]: That thinking goes hand in hand with people who squander their 
time and make poor decisions. I look forward to every new year because 
there’s more progress and it’s fun building on top of the long term 
decisions I made years ago. I think delayed gratification is one of the 
most important qualities to learn at a young age.
[mercurydivider]: I've heard this phenomenon coined a quarter life crisis.
The thing about age is nobody knows what age you are unless you 
tell them. If you're always complaining that you're old, then people 
notice.
[boghopper2000]: I'm 23 and I feel like an ancient fossil. /s
[8six753hoe9]: It’s not just your generation, mate. I fell into a huge depression
 at 25 that took me 6+ months to recover from. I felt like my life was 
half over and I hadn’t accomplished anything, and I had no talent or 
prospects and I was going to be poor and stuck forever.
It’s now 24 years later and, provided I don’t die in the next year
 (fingers crossed, knock wood, etc.), literally everything I feared has 
been proven wrong.
I think it’s natural to feel a bit unmoored in your 20s. I think 
most people go through some uncertainty about the future, and we live in
 a society that fetishizes youth. If you’re not on TV and driving a 
Lambo by 19, what’s the point, right?! It’ll all work out.
[Sninxitey]: 25-27 have been some of the most freeing years of my life. I would
 rather die than be 20-24 again. I was tired, broke, and ugly at those 
ages.
However, this isn’t a Gen Z thing. Boomers have reinforced 
ideologies that carried over. Especially for women. If you were 25 and 
not married with kids they would assume there was something wrong with 
you and call you an old hag or whatever.
[ABewilderedPickle]: fuck that. iAM25 and i intend on going to college next 
year to pursue my passion in writing. i have a lot of things that are 
kinda fucked up for me right now, but that was true 4 years ago too and i
 did manage to fully recover in between these times.
honestly i think my 25-30 is going to be a good few years for me personally if i maintain my mental health
[tn3tnba]: Young people often think this way, I remember being in college and
 thinking 22 was over the hill lol. Late 30’s now, easily my most fun 
and fulfilling decade so far
[ric00002]: The answer is: Covid.
The feeling of wasted years and lost youth is everywhere. I don't 
blame anyone for feeling a bit depressed and insecure regarding life 
achivements.
[WhySoComplicaded]: I don’t get the sense that people our age think that life is over.
 Not to negate what you’ve observed, I’m sure you are experience is 
real.
I do however get the sense that we’re expected to really start 
acting like adults and get our shit together beginning at age 25. I 
think that’s a great time to start tightening up.
[mimiiscool]: I’m 25 and still working on my masters and eventually my PHD I 
kinda like where I’m at but I’m excited for what the future will bring
[sleepdeep305]: Sure, my gf’s mom became a nurse at 33 (and later started to 
travel) but even almost 20 years later they’re still struggling to find 
affordable housing even though most of their kids are graduated
[Bbenjipc]: I told a classmate in my maths class that I was 21, and he 
literally jumped as if he was watching a horror movie and yelled: "21?!"
 He is 19.
[Vivi_Pallas]: Life doesn't end at 25
Life ends at 30 🙃
Okay but for real, I feel like a lot of those early life 
opportunities die out at around 30. The dating pool is smaller, you 
could go to college but can't get the traditional "college experience", 
etc.
[justaBB6]: I just wish I could learn faster.
High school sucked. Undergrad went from rough to miserable. Most 
personal life goals I’ve set out to do I have either fallen short of, or
 outright abandoned. I am  so far behind so many in my peer group.
I have my diploma now, and I’m working a job with benefits that 
pays more than minimum wage. Not enough to leave my folks’ place with 
one biweekly paycheck a month going to tuition loans, but I might be 
looking at buying my first car around Q2 next year.
There’s so much I still want to do, and yet so much I have not 
been capable of achieving for myself, despite my best efforts and 
despite some evidence that implies a capacity for these things. It feels
 like I’ve been given gifts I’m actively squandering, for myself and for
 people I care about.
I need to know that I can still look forward to growth 
opportunities in the future that aren’t going to play out the exact same
 as everything in recent memory.
I don’t know what I need to do to figure out how my brain works. 
I’m in therapy and have been for some time, except now things across the
 rest of my life, for the first time in years, are relatively copacetic.
 I think we might just be starting to dig into things.
I don’t really know why I typed all that, but maybe it could serve
 as a progress report for future me, and maybe it might even make one or
 two other people in these comments feel less alone.
I turn 25 next June.
[Ok-Intention-2458]: I personally don’t feel like you’re describing, but honestly the 
world is a scary place these days. If you only make minimum wage up 
until your mid 20s and you really start doing the math, it can be really
 hard to envision a world where you aren’t just scraping by. Today 
making poor decisions in your youth is more punishing than ever before
[KimberBr]: I went to college at 26 and graduated twice. I got married at 36. Life is not over at 25. I promise
[[deleted]]: 25 is young af. Who's saying that!?! Lmao.
[Any-Video4464]: Haha. Life has barely begun at 25. You guys are crazy. I'm 46 and 
have a fucking blast. I wish I could feel 25 again and have all the 
energy I used to have. Don't take it for granted is all I have to say. 
Enjoy your life before real life and big responsibilities roll your way.
[Racist_carbonara]: I just read a post asking if it was too late to play videogames cause they turned 20😂
[fuckyourcanoes]: Y'all need to chill. I'm 56 and I'm still having fun. I go to live
 shows and SF cons, I travel, I play games, I play music, and I go to 
kinky events. I sing silly songs to my cat and I have SHOCK and AWE 
written on the toe caps of my green suede Converse.
You don't have to be a boring adult if you don’t want to. My 
parents put away childish things and they were miserable. I didn't want 
to end up like them. So I didn't. I have a rabbi friend from high school
 who still goes to punk shows and gets in the mosh pit. A lot of my 
friends are still in the same bands from their 20s.
Do things on your own timetable. Fuck what other people think of you.
[jaczk5]: I became disabled at 24 and it felt like it was when I was 25 as I
 struggled with medical conditions that make every day painful.
[itsame73]: It’s a mix of lack of life experience, when we were 18 we couldn’t
 imagine what it would be like to be 25 because it felt so far 
away…mixed with the pressure to succeed and not be “lazy” pushed on us 
by social media and our capitalist society..mixed with shallowness of 
beauty standards which are complete bullshit but we keep buying into it 
(looking at you gymbros who think a rioded body is natty and achievable)
And then bam some of us blinked and now we are 23-26 and comparing
 ourselves to “self made” millionaires and celebrities all reaching 
their success when they were 20 or even younger.
We have to  start realizing these standards are not fair and are 
in fact used as a tool to manipulate us into buying a product or working
 ourselves to death for the “grind” so maybe one day it we are lucky we 
could get that promotion and maybe one day if we grind hard enough we’ll
 be a millionaire….(all the while we are actually just making a 
billionaire or an investor more rich)…and hate to break it to ya but 
there is 99% chance of that not happening…and I wouldn’t want to work my
 life away for a 1% chance of being super successful…I’d rather tear up 
the system and make a better one.
When we truly start living for ourselves and not society is when life truly starts.
[Pop-A-Top]: I'll be starting a college degree when i'm 25 next September. I 
just never found what I wanted to be doing my entire life until now
[elderly_millenial]: Don’t be too hard on your generation for that. I think every 
generation has this sense at that point in life, probably because when 
we are younger we place that time in our lives on some pedestal. It’s 
youth, and ignorance is a feature, not a bug.
[Slyder68]: I'm graduating with my bachelor's at 31, after dropping out to 
stop wasting money while I figured out what I want to do. Life starts in
 the mid 20's

I have no idea if i want advice or not. This is a mix of me asking for help and a rant, its mostly aimless
For context, im in my mid/early 20's in the USA
Ive spent my entire life busy. studying, training, working.
Through my teens I was a student athlete. I trained for 8 hours a 
day, studied for 8 hours a day, rinse and repeat. Whenever my family 
went on vacation the location was decided based on if there was a 
training facility nearby for me. Id be up before dawn as always and 
training while they relaxed. Everywhere I ever travelled was for 
competition or training. Its all been hotels and arenas. I was supposed 
to compete in Canada and Japan in 2020 but we all know what happened 
that year
Eventually I retired the sport. I know work 35 hours a week as a 
software developer and im taking 15-16 credits per semester for two 
years now, including as many credits as i can during summer
I have the opportunity to maybe take a vacation soon but
I dont know where i want to go
I dont know what i want to do
I almost WANT to keep working working working. But that doesnt seem sustainable without some rest
I feel like i go nuts when not training, studying, or working 
though. I always need to be doing something. Ive got my video games and 
working out to fill any spare time i have still, but thats only for 1-2 
hours at a time, just filler yk?
I need something bigger. A whole week of something else. I love 
what i do but i feel like im about to burnout from sheer exhaustion

I (17F) rarely use Reddit at all anymore and this is my first time
 writing an actual long post but I hope many people see this and realize
 the significant negative impact that the pandemic had on students, 
especially disabled students, and how things will never be the same ever
 again.
For some background, I am autistic/ADHD and I go to a very small 
alternative school with only around 150 or so students in total, so to 
be fair I probably never truly had a “normal” high school experience to 
begin with but I will be using the term “normal” in a different context-
 referring to all in-person, maskless, etc.
COVID happened during my freshman year, and it was a living 
nightmare for me. As someone who relies heavily on social 
stimulation/interaction, the lockdown was brutal and the isolation set 
me years back developmentally. In addition to this, I also began abusing
 alcohol (prior to lockdown I swore I would never touch booze but then 
shit happened), which probably gave me some level of permanent brain 
damage, and living with the stress of the entire world collapsing around
 me certainly didn’t help.
I returned to in-person school (wearing masks of course) in 
September of that year thanks to an accommodation (around a quarter of 
the students at my school returned in-person at the same time as me 
doing a hybrid schedule, the rest were completely online) and for the 
entirety of sophomore year, it was a hybrid schedule for most students 
(my sister and I were at school all five days a week, we did our classes
 on zoom at school in a small room on the days in which the rest of the 
school was online) at the end of sophomore year, students began 
returning to school and I was absolutely astounded at how they managed 
to survive over a year at home. I (quite literally) would have been dead
 had I been forced to do that (The lockdown and quarantine period of 
2020 caused me to develop suicidal ideation, so if it had gone on as 
long as it did for most students, I highly doubt I’d be here today 
writing this).
Junior year was more “normal”-ish? Most, if not all of the 
students had returned at this point but we were still wearing masks up 
until February, and even after that there was still a general sense of 
sluggishness and burnout among the students and staff, some students 
continued to wear masks and it wasn’t until the end of junior year that 
things finally felt somewhat “normal”.
And now I am a senior, and I absolutely fucking hate that I am a 
senior now. I am not ready at all. I am unemployed, chronically 
irresponsible, easily distracted, slow, stupid, socially and cognitively
 underdeveloped, immature, impulsive, unmotivated and just generally 
careless. I am going absolutely nowhere in life and painfully aware of 
it. I don’t enjoy education anymore, I still very much enjoy going to 
school to get the social interaction and companionship I need, and 
having the typical in-person experience I had before everything went to 
hell, but I’ve pretty much given up on actually learning.
These days I typically get only one assignment done per day, if at
 all. I am so incredibly behind that it doesn’t even scare me anymore. I
 have grown completely numb to the fact that I’m failing in nearly every
 class. I just distract myself on my phone, wander around the room or do
 something pointless to avoid getting anything done. I’ll frequently 
have my computer open pretending to be working.
The teachers have caught on to the fact that I’m not doing my 
work, but they don’t seem to care enough to actually intervene. The most
 I’ll get from them is a “you really need to get your assignments done 
before the trimester ends” but never any threats of actual disciplinary 
action. My school is incredibly lenient and we don’t even get much work 
to begin with, but I’m so unmotivated that even the little amount of 
work I get still feels like alot.
Even though I returned early, I feel like that wasn’t and still 
isn’t nearly enough. And the worst part about all of this is that 
despite all of the pain and trauma and setbacks- I am one of the lucky 
ones. I got to return to in-person school early. Most kids my age didn’t
 have that option, which means that for them it was probably even worse,
 and that hurts my heart to think about.
An entire generation of kids are now unprepared for adulthood, 
many are turning to substances to cope, others are acting out, 
destroying school property, lashing out at others, and many have already
 moved on to college with an entire chunk of their lives missing. It’s a
 very bleak and tragic outcome for an entire generation of students, and
 the effects of it will most likely follow them for the rest of their 
lives.
I know that what I’m planning on doing is incredibly stupid, could
 possibly get me expelled and might not even work, but I truly feel like
 I need an extra year to make up for the sense of normalcy I lost. I 
don’t care about my future anymore, I know that regardless of if I 
graduate or not I will still be stuck in the same position I’ve always 
been in, so really this is more about healing from pandemic trauma and 
catching up on social development than anything else. Please don’t do 
what I am doing unless you too are in a position where nothing really 
matters anymore. I know I’m ruining my life, I’ve been setting myself up
 for failure for many years, and I’ve known for a long time that I am 
destined to be nothing so please don’t ruin your life or waste any 
potential you have because you saw some 17 year old autistic girl on 
Reddit do it. You are not me.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[queen_0f_cringe]: I’m still adamant about my decision but thanks for that bit of 
insight. As I said, my life is already pretty much destined to go 
nowhere, mostly due to my disabilities, and I’ve just come to accept 
that. I’ve already finished grieving the life I’ll never have.
[palisher]: My perspective as a 23M who went through SPED all through my 
schooling; Covid or not, no one is ready for adulthood when they 
graduate high school that’s the dirty secret no one wants to admit and 
you will likely not gain anything from an extra year of school. Life 
ain’t easy especially for neurodivergent individuals so why make it 
harder for yourself by joining life late.
[whisperwhisperwhisp]: None of us can compel you to finish school on time and none of us know your exact situation.
That said, as another commented, absolutely nobody is ready for 
the real world. School does not make anyone ready for "adult" life.
One more year of high school is not going to solve this problem 
for you. You know you're driven by social interaction, so you need to 
find out how to get more of it, even without school.
You're also not interested in class anymore. That's fine, but you 
need to find something you are interested in. Even if it's not 
productive for society, you will stagnate indefinitely if you spend all 
day staring at your phone or walking around doing nothing. That's no way
 to live your life.
[Rachelcookie123]: I understand how you feel. The pandemic was really hard for me 
too. I’m supposed to be finishing high school right now. My friends are 
all going off to university in January but I don’t feel ready. Time 
froze for me during covid and I haven’t changed since then but the world
 kept moving and everyone else kept changing. I haven’t developed since 
covid started. I think it’s a good idea to wait another year. If you’re 
not ready yet then it could be very damaging to try go out on your own 
now. Just make sure that you failing a year won’t hurt your future 
plans.
[[deleted]]: You’re choosing to be a victim. Instead of trying to move forward 
you’re lingering in the past, you can’t go back in time and get what you
 missed. Life is not fair, it’s up to you to work with what you’ve got. 
Good luck to you.
I’m glad I’m getting differing thoughts and opinions on my decision, really helps me navigate the nuances of it.

[Original-Income-28]: Started working at age 13 I’ve got add and learning problems And 
just retired from a state goverment job As office asst Ham radio 
electronics Are my hobby
Without my nigh school I could not of got my job I retired from
I’m Age 65
[TranslatorHaunting15]: I think life gets better after high school tbh there’s a whole 
world out there to experience high school is a small 4 years of life 
that once you’re older just doesn’t feel that significant. No one is 
really ready for adulthood when they’re 17-18. You figure life out as 
you go, you learn from your experiences and stuff.
My situation is different. My disabilities make me less prepared 
for the outside world regardless of how long I stay in school for. Look 
up the unemployment rate for autistic people then come back here. I know
 it’s not impossible and I am somewhat “high-functioning” enough to 
(maybe??) hold down a smaller job but the point is- I want to stay 
behind not to improve my life skills (even though I probably should) but
 rather to get one more year of “normal” because I feel like the 
pandemic robbed it from me and it feels wrong to only have one entirely 
normal year and then it’s over. I hope what I’m saying makes sense.

I’m either overqualified or underqualified for ENTRY-LEVEL jobs. 
The back to back rejections and ghosting is exhausting. Don’t get me 
started with those highly optimistic moments during the final stage of 
the hiring process. All I want is to make enough money to pay bills and 
support my family.
Anyone else experiencing the same?

[EruzaMoth]: This is 2025, you don't get "support my family" money.
You get "4 roommates, and all of you can barely afford to make rent each month" money.
[Delli-paper]: You know you don't need to put everything in your application to jobs you're overqualified for, right?
Yeah, I know. I typically apply for jobs I meet the requirements for. I don’t understand how I keep being told either.
Because you exceed them too much

[[deleted]]: I make enough to support my family, but I have a $75k income from 
my employer and an extra $22k from VA disability. If I lost disability, 
my spouse would have to work full time.
Keep in mind that the job and salary you describe are probably 
available somewhere, but that might be in a different city and state. 
These jobs being available wherever you live is the kind of opportunity 
past generations have had, but doesn't reflect reality now. $80k in 
Seattle and $80k in Boise are two very different offers.
Widen your search and consider CoL at each posted job location.
[Vast-Stranger-4791]: There’s just no jobs for us in this economy. There’s no job growth and unemployment is already super low.
[trulymadlymax]: honestly, networking will help you so much. Can you join a local 
or remote toastmasters club or young entrepreneur club? make connections
 with people who have jobs and they will think of you if they have a 
position coming up.
this is how I landed 2 of my professional jobs.
this is helpful when you have the time to build those relationships not so helpful if you need a job like tomorrow lol
if you need a job tomorrow, then consider going to a local strip club for immeidiate work.
you can make a couple hundred a night.
stripping can be a lucrative way to bridge the gap.
chile at that point i’ll just be a sugar baby

[That0neJawn]: I have experienced something similar.The country and exact 
circumstances are probably different (for example, I don't have a 
family), but I can relate well to the feeling.
In mid-2023, I finished my design education. I knew getting into 
any part of that industry could be hard, but I was somewhat hopeful. I 
also decided to take a bit of a break before starting with applications 
and got an unrelated part-time job at a cool retail store to support 
myself.
Early 2024, I started writing applications.That was a horrible
 experience overall, I really can't recommend it. Scouting for 
positions, writing/editing tons of letters and emails and waiting for 
replies that never came was freaking draining.I also got some 
surprisingly good interviews with very unlucky rejections- but also 
ended up giving a rejection myself in the very end.Unfortunately, I 
also have no smart, surefire advice to assist you in your journey, but I
 can tell you about some things that helped me a bit.
I set achievable goals. I focused on a steady output over sheer 
mass and started writing one application per weekday, but consistently. 
Call me lazy if you find that too little, but that was a pace I could 
comfortably manage over a longer time. Obviously, adjust to what you can
 do. Ultimately, job huntingcan bea bit of a numbers game. You can't burn out after two weeks, right?
I tried to keep myself active- in my case, by going on walks and 
swimming. Movement helped. Being outside helped. It's that simple- the 
effect might not be immediately noticeable on paper, but it keeps you 
sane.
In general, I did other things. Took free time after hitting my 
daily target to do what I wanted. Enjoying time with friends, playing 
video games, building digital LEGO models, whatever. Getting a "real" 
job was a priority, but I wasn't immediately struggling and realized 
that keeping myself decently capable and motivated would be really dang 
important in the long run. Again- this is for your own sanity. It is 
important too.
I tried to look at rejections after good interviews as a good 
sign. It's incredibly easy to feel like you're not good enough in these 
moments- your heart just sinks when you get that dreaded call or email. 
However, there is another perspective to it; Yes, you got rejected in 
the end, but you also got really dang far. There are companies out there
 that are interested in what you have to offer, interested enough to get
 you through the entire process. That is a good sign, even if it 
technically doesn't help your situation. But it means there is interest.
 Also- every interview will give you "interview XP" that helps you in 
the next one.
TLDR;- consistency over sheer quantity- stay sane- all interviews are good
Lastly, keep in mind that an application is a two-way-street. Yes,
 you are applying at a company, but the company is also applying at you.
 Show yourself to them, but also let them show themselves to you. Ask 
genuine questions, don't be afraid to show a bit of personality, you 
wouldn't be there is there was no interest.
You can make it.
[Impossible-Key-2212]: Start applying to other fields.  Manufacturing, join a trade 
union, air traffic controllers, oil fields, construction.  There are 7

That was the federal government report yesterday.  I heard on the dive into work.  I have not looked it up.

change based on your opinion.
I guess I am in need of some life advice from people who “get it”.
 I went to school, did the whole college thing and even went to graduate
 school, only to drop out halfway through. I got a bullshit degree that I
 can’t find a job with, parents who don’t understand, and a low paying 
job.
My question is how do I turn my life around? It feels too late as I
 am broke, have lots of student loans, etc. so going back to school 
isn’t as easy as it sounds. I’m thinking a lot about how much i would 
love to live in a different country. i’m just not sure how to make that 
happen?
im tired of having no money and no current or future prospects 
going for me. I excelled in school, just for the workforce to send me 
into burnout or something.
i feel like i need a drastic change in my life and i need advice on what i should do.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[[deleted]]: Watch Fight Club
[[deleted]]: i had a similar situation when i graduated. majored in psych but 
didn’t want to go to grad school so there’s not much i can do with it. i
 do the income based loan repayment and just plan on paying the minimum 
until they forgive them or i die 🤷 i would suggest just trying to find a
 job you enjoy that pays enough to stay stable. after trying out a job 
in the psych field and not enjoying it i worked at a dog daycare for a 
year and loved it and even though it payed a little less i was much 
happier. especially if you’re still living at home that will make it 
easier to save up. and try applying for things you might not think 
you’ll get, you never know. people get jobs they aren’t qualified for 
all the time.
[Popular_Bass_9207]: Find the biggest cylinder you have a stick it in you butt. It will feel awesome.
[Southurnbelle]: If you don’t mind me asking what’s your degree in?
anthropology
My professor had her doctorate in anthropology and she focused on 
France and Germany, but now she’s an Af-AM professor. Idk if that helps.
 But some of my friends do museum work with that degree

[Either-Condition4586]: Study in university to have high education
[AgnosticAbe]: You need life advice from people who “get it”. You’ve come to 
probably the worst place for that advice. First things first do you have
 a job? Are you living with your parents? If not do you have a good 
enough relationship to start living with them?
Not paying rent and even having a shit paying job, you can save up
 some serious cash quickly. As kids were taught education comes first 
but as an adult fixing your money woes comes first. I’m 20, haven’t even
 started college yet and when I turned 20 I had maybe 1 dollar and 50 
cents to my name, I wasn’t doing anything and just wasting my life away.
I got a job at literal Walmart a couple weeks after turning 20 so 
like in April of this year I got a job at Walmart and have saved up 6 
grand. I can afford to do things, I can afford to gas my parents car, I 
can go out with friends, I’m not rich hell no but just having some 
money, like helps your mental a lot

I get that shit is bad but not every nail needs to be hammered down.
Sit back and enjoy something for once in your life without thinking of the sensitivities behind it.
So what if it has gay people in it
So what if a side character is wearing a maga hat
I don't care if the Burger King ad has a hot chick eating a whopper or Bud Light wanted to advertise with a trans woman.
Lots of you need to sit back and enjoy life without being 
inebriated because every time I hear you guys complaining it makes me 
think you just don't want to be alive in general.

Smart. Don't buy paper anything.
When you’re young, it’s easier to live the way I’m suggesting. 
Have no idea what you’re talking about with older people can’t give 
advice or input on this. The older people(35-60) are the ones who feel 
the pressure to save and make money as they are facing the reality of 
things like college funds, debt on their houses, and the big one, being 
old as fuck one day.
From 18-30 there is waaayyy less pressure to have money that 
you’ll need in 20 or 30 years. If anyone feels this way, they have been 
duped.
Take care of your health and mental health if you want the best life.
Yeah, rent can be tough to make. If this is about rent and bills, I
 get it. If your issue is about buying shit and travel and always 
needing to spend on Uber eats and shit, you’ve been sucked into the 
fantasy vortex.
Hahahhahha. It’s how I lived my entire life. Of course, I went out
 with my friends and drank, but I lived minimally, always. It’s just 
dumb to buy shit, a waste, and it has ZERO to do with happiness. Yall 
are being fooled, along with millions in every generation.
And if you are one of those who believe traveling is a need to be happy, well, that’s more brainwashing.
Buddy, people can't even buy shit in certain first world countries
 right now, that's what I mean. If you think these kids are buying shit 
and traveling without going into debt you are sorely mistaken. Most of 
em' don't at all. Go get groceries without your pension money next time 
and tell me how well that works out for ya' okay?
How about you do something to earn a living wage
Go be a Sous Chef for a while then come back and say that.
I’m not going to do that because I have life goals that wouldn’t be sustained by that lol
So you're saying a sous chef shouldn't make a living wage? I'm also curious what will sustain your 'life goals' exactly?
Edit: yeah this dipshit has no ground to stand on. A non answer 
and he doesn't even make that crazy amount of money. What a turd.
I don’t live in the world of “Should” and “Shouldn’t” - I live in the world of “Does” and “Doesn’t”.
You told me to go try being a sous chef. That career won’t sustain
 my long term life goals. Purchase a home, support a family, retire in 
my early 50’s. That’s why I’m not going to go and be a sous chef. You 
chose that knowing what the pay was, I guess. That’s your bad - not 
mine. If you dig it, that’s cool, but don’t complain about not bringing 
home a living wage when you’re the one that chose to pursue that.
What will sustain my life goals: a job that has a good salary, a pension, and lots of room for growth.

Yeah, rent can be tough to make. If this is about rent and bills, I
 get it. If your issue is about buying shit and travel and always 
needing to spend on Uber eats and shit, you’ve been sucked into the 
fantasy vortex.
[MorganMiller77777]: Hahahhahha. It’s how I lived my entire life. Of course, I went out
 with my friends and drank, but I lived minimally, always. It’s just 
dumb to buy shit, a waste, and it has ZERO to do with happiness. Yall 
are being fooled, along with millions in every generation.
And if you are one of those who believe traveling is a need to be happy, well, that’s more brainwashing.
Buddy, people can't even buy shit in certain first world countries
 right now, that's what I mean. If you think these kids are buying shit 
and traveling without going into debt you are sorely mistaken. Most of 
em' don't at all. Go get groceries without your pension money next time 
and tell me how well that works out for ya' okay?

[CalStateQuarantine]: How about you do something to earn a living wage
Go be a Sous Chef for a while then come back and say that.
I’m not going to do that because I have life goals that wouldn’t be sustained by that lol
So you're saying a sous chef shouldn't make a living wage? I'm also curious what will sustain your 'life goals' exactly?
Edit: yeah this dipshit has no ground to stand on. A non answer 
and he doesn't even make that crazy amount of money. What a turd.
I don’t live in the world of “Should” and “Shouldn’t” - I live in the world of “Does” and “Doesn’t”.
You told me to go try being a sous chef. That career won’t sustain
 my long term life goals. Purchase a home, support a family, retire in 
my early 50’s. That’s why I’m not going to go and be a sous chef. You 
chose that knowing what the pay was, I guess. That’s your bad - not 
mine. If you dig it, that’s cool, but don’t complain about not bringing 
home a living wage when you’re the one that chose to pursue that.
What will sustain my life goals: a job that has a good salary, a pension, and lots of room for growth.
Yep

[redpandaonstimulants]: I sort of agree, but "Why can't we all just get along?" doesn't 
always make sense. If you're trans or an immigrant, the guy wearing a 
maga hat might start screaming slurs at you. Your politician, whether 
Democrat or Republican, can vote for legislation that fucks you over.
Don't ever be a doomer, don't resign yourself to misery and 
stagnation. However, there's nothing wrong with feeling angry, or 
fearful, or sad. I genuinely hate my life rn, but I'm learning another 
language and I'm getting back into drawing because I want to leave this 
town I hate rather than rot here, and I want to create real art, not 
some disgusting AI simulacrum.
Don’t be overwhelmed by pervasive fear, anger and sadness. And if 
one is overwhelmed by these emotions on a regular basis, it’s like some 
level of mental illness is present.

[Bobloblaw878]: When I was younger it was pretty normal for friends to get an 
apartment with like 5 other people and just have fun. Did some have to 
share a room? Maybe but it was a start and we weren't living in our 
parents house. And I mean late into our 20s. I didn't know anyone who 
got their shit together before they were mid 30s or later. I think y'all
 have unrealistic expectations.
Damn, it was normal to have at least 5 friends all in the same 
area and working at the same time? That's honestly kind of crazy in and 
of itself.
We weren't necessarily all friends but usually became friends 
because we all had the same goals. Get out of our parents house and 
start life. Maybe everyone today likes the comforts of Mom and Dad's 
house, they don't have to grow up and likely dont have to clean much.
Ok, 5 acquaintances is still quite a lot to have all in the same 
place that you get along with well enough to live with. Still an 
exceptional circumstance.

[woodworkingfonatic]: You’re talking to either mostly millennials (weird because it’s a 
GenZ sub) which the vast majority are good. Or you are talking to people
 born after 2000 and have a very skewed world view towards being 
pessimistic (again not all). Just scroll the sub and comments and you’ll
 find people claiming the sky is falling every day of the week.
It’s really hard to be happy when you hitch your wagons to 
politics and make it the only thing your personality is based on. Social
 media has amplified that even more.
Are they so into politics? Most of the time I hear people here 
simply complaining about things (boomers) and claiming that not voting 
is the only way to deal - or that it's a waste of time because boomers 
have it rigged. Zs are never going to improve their lives without 
getting involved.
Yes they are into politics because the majority of posts here are 
always moaning and whining about politics or has some political slant. 
That is inherently political.
Actually getting involved means climbing a ladder or becoming a 
protege or being able to work under someone. when politicians are 
increasingly staying in positions of power and not bringing in young 
people and the young people who do get brought in are middle to late 40s
 it’s hard for young people to even get a foot in the door.
Regardless of that go out and meet people, go exercise, go build 
something, and go help people when you can. Politics does not make up 
for lack of a personality and getting out into the world and meeting 
people.
Sophistry. It's a great excuse to not try. The rich and powerful count on it. Good luck with that.
Go ahead and see what arguing politics online all the time does. 
You’ll quickly find that most people don’t care and they want to get on 
with their lives. I’m not saying you can’t have political opinions but 
not to make them your entire personality.  argue your points and what 
you believe i have no problem with that.
As it stands not many young people are able to get into politics 
that guy in Florida and AOC are very few and far between and only 
because their districts perfectly align to where they can sweep the 
vote. If you’re interested in politics go to your local meetings arguing
 online only can do so much.

[inhaledpie4]: People kinda do need to care less about what large corporations do
 with their ads, glad we live in an age where adblockers exist, and we 
all know it's ingenuine virtue signaling and whatever anyway.
I get that being upset about things, especially political stuff, 
is important. Being upset causes people to fight for change which is 
good. Buuuuutttttt people are missing the point of the post because of 
the language you used, so allow me to phrase it another way. Don't make 
being upset about thingsyour whole personality!
Find a way to enjoy life. Make hobbies, talk about fun things with
 your friends. Make friends if you don't have friends. Touch grass or 
play video games. Whatever keeps your boats afloat. Too many people have
 depression and anxiety right now because we have too much access to 
worldwide information, constant catastrophies. It is good to take a 
periodic break from this. I'm not saying "get off social media" I'm 
saying that maybe, once a week, take a day off from it. Reset your 
brain. You will be so much happier. Genuinely.

TÍTULO: Mental health at work isn’t optional - planning to resign after vacation : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Posting this under discussion because I’d love to hear if others have been through something similar.
I’ve been working under a 65+ boss who constantly snaps and speaks
 with no emotional awareness. No basic kindness, no consideration for 
how her tone affects others. Just cold and harsh and an absolute bully —
 every single day. I’ve only been there 3 months, and my anxiety has 
never been this bad from a job before. There have been times when i have
 sobbed in my car after work. My diet is lost, all i eat is junk all day
 all night.
I’m currently on vacation, and it’s been such a reset. I’ve 
decided I’m going to resign when I get back. I accepted a fully remote 
role — they’re not doing my work visa, but honestly? My mental health is
 more important. My current job is offering a visa, but I had to really 
ask myself: at what cost?
I also have a backup plan, so I don’t feel trapped anymore. Just 
knowing I have options already makes me feel more in control.
It’s made me think a lot about how we (especially in our 
generation) aren’t willing to tolerate toxic environments just for the 
“security” of a job. I’d rather have peace of mind than dread every day 
of the week.
Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Did you stick it out or leave?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[daffy_M02]: Yes, I agree that mental health leave should be an option in jobs, with a limited duration allowed.
[WildlyAwesome]: I used to work a retail job and quickly got promoted to a 
department manager position. Quitting was the best thing for my mental 
health ever. It didn’t seem to matter that my department, no matter how 
understaffed always did the best. It didn’t matter how good my numbers 
were, or how many OT hours I had to work to do it. It was never good 
enough. One second was “you have to work OT because bla bla bla” then 
the next was “why does your department have so many used OT hours?!” 
Then if there was a new store manager I was treated poorly because I was
 the youngest manager of that department they have ever met. Corporate 
surprise walks every couple of weeks that would turn the store managers 
into demons and rarely a thank you for doing the impossible. It didn’t 
matter if I was always one of the best of that department in that 
division, it was always “well why isn’t it even better?” The only people
 who got promoted to the next position were either hires from other 
companies, or you found out they and someone else got fired because 
someone walked in on them sucking someone off. No more dealing with 
shitty corporate or shitty customers, I don’t miss it one bit.
They chewed up a motivated young hardworking man and spat it out 
instead of turning me into someone who would’ve grown in the company and
 done things the right way. The looks on their faces when I suddenly 
handed them my two weeks notice was priceless. The panic that they 
didn’t have someone to replace me yet when those two weeks were 
finished. Trying to get me to stay and telling them no, as well as 
telling them I was taking a paycut just to leave.  Shopping in that same
 store after as a customer and no longer an employee. Now I’m making 
more than I made there, have a normal schedule with weekends and 
holidays off. The first Christmas I didn’t have to stress out over and 
kill myself at work felt magical. Sure I was eventually replaced. I hope
 that poor soul gets treated better or finds a new job eventually.
What are you doing now?
Now I work for my father. I used to work with him when I was 12-17
 when he hurt his back (had a herniated disk. ) after the housing market
 caused the company he worked for (they built houses) to get rid of his 
position. It was all handyman construction and yard work. Then I 
finished high school and got the retail job. Years later after falling 
out with my relationship with him (his wife, my stepmother didn’t like 
me) he made up with me and apologized and our relationship healed. (I’m 
of course leaving some stuff out as it’s a long story) I told him I was 
going to quit my job and he offered for me to work for him again. I 
accepted.
Now it’s still handyman type of stuff but we’ve grown the company 
and now have over 25 employees. So it’s a mix of inspections, some handy
 man shit, and working from home on the computer. It’s hard work, 
sometimes super tedious, but every day is a bit different. The moment I 
put in my two weeks I was going to work as a plumbers helper before my 
dad offered to hire me. Was a rough paycut because at the time he 
couldn’t afford to pay me as much but we’ve grown a lot and now I make 
more. Thankfully I’m blessed with this opportunity

[OSRS-ruined-my-life]: I don't care, I just do whatever's the best pay available. I don't
 think about coworkers or bosses after I clock out. Work is not part of 
my personality or identity. Just a means to an end, and I will retire 
the second I can afford too.
I also try to do the absolute bare minimum to not get fired which 
if you think about it is technically what I'm being paid for.
I basically judge that by how long it's been since I got called in
 to see HR or a manager and got an earfull. If it's been too long, I 
start working less. If it's a little too often, I try a little more.
Whenever they start chewing me out, I just play a little dumb and 
simpy and go back to what I was doing. "Oh yeah, yeah, damn I didn't 
know, last guy wanted it like this. Oh really? I don't even know how to 
do that youre basically like a genius! I'll look into it."
If it's too hot, I go on vacation and hope they forget about me 
after not seeing me for a while. Alternative is take the days whoever's 
mad works as days off so you see other people only. That's truly an 
underrated trick. If manager A is mad AF at you, and you don't see them 
again for a few months, they usually forget about you just in time for 
manager B to be mad.

[capital_gainesville]: I never said anything about charity. I agree that philanthropy is more about power than helping people in many cases.
Wealthy people produce things, innovate, save, and invest in the 
future. They drive society forward while most people are happy to remain

Charity is generally regarded as a “moral act” that the wealthy 
takes to “give back”, that is why I bring it up. The fact the wealthy 
can’t even fulfill one of the most basic acts of mutual aid should 
display that they struggle to act for the common good.
This is not the case, you cannot claim the wealthy are “moral” as they invest in the future while they simultaneously arepollutingit; At a rate far higher than that of the average person.
Preserving your own planet and giving funds directly to 
organizations in need is some of the most basic acts of moral behavior 
you can do, the wealthy elite can’t even fulfill that.

[[deleted]]: While that may be partly true, if there’s an automation problem we
 need to tax businesses that use such automation tools and implement a 
UBI program
Wait you want to implement a tax on automating technology? I’m I understanding this correctly?
As for the UBI from where are you going to get the money. Let me 
remind you that not even the Nordic countries have UBI, as a consequence
 there is very little scientific evidence for UBI, we only have 
theoretical works but that’s it.
Only If it gets to the point to where there’s not enough jobs for 
regular people to survive, we are not currently at that point

 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I don’t mean this in an edgy or dramatic way — just something I’ve been thinking about lately as a 27-year-old GenZ.
A lot of us arealready dealing with burnout, 
depression, and career struggles and overall anxious about our future. 
Between the economy falling apart, political absurdity and violence, 
insane housing issues, inflation, the state of job market— life’s hard, 
and we’re not even old yet.
Right now, most of us still keep going because we have energy, 
some plans some hope that we can build a life worth living. I feel that 
myself — I’m still trying, still chasing the carrot.But I wonder what happens when we hit 55, 60, 70… and that energy and hope runs out.
And I can see how it can be happenning. Unlike past generations,we’re mostly non-religious. We’re already havingopen conversations about things like euthanasia,
 etc. We don’t romanticize suffering, and many of us decide not to have 
kids in this economy, which can make the exit even easier... This is 
some of thefactorts why I wouldn’t be surprisedif, when that time comes, a lot of people just decide to leave on their own terms.
Not out of depression, but out of exhaustion, or just… lack of options.
It’s obviously a heavy topic, but it weirdly doesn’t feel scary to me. It almost feels comforting?
I can totally see this unserious generation making an 
"end-of-life" party a trend. Imagine a costume party where everyone 
dresses up as a different era of the host's life, celebrating it 
together before they go, something like that.
Curious if anyone else has had similar thoughts. Is this something we’re going to see become normal in our lifetime?

[Any_Personality5413]: I agree with you. Especially since I'll probably never get to 
retire, and double especially as a child-free person I feel like at a 
certain age there's just not gonna be a real reason for me to try and 
stick around any longer
Nah same, if I can’t retire by 65, I’m opening a shit ton of credit cards to travel the world before I conk out
How many credit cards we gotta open for this? Won't credit catch up..
Not if you ded, debt collectors cannot chase others for your debt
Oh so like open 10, 20 credit cards with say 1000 or 3000 limit on
 them each? I was thinking if you already had 1 card open, they wouldn't
 accept you for more
You are correct. The exact number will depend on your income, 
credit history, existing debt, etc. Some people won’t even be able to 
open one card. If you’re a high earner with pristine credit history, 
you’ll probably be able to open a few, but even then, they’ll cut you 
off at some point.

[GorillaGrip68]: exactly my thoughts.
[Extension_End6244]: As much as I understand this post is meant to be a more thoughtful
 discussion of what the future might hold, I still think it’s almost 
impossible to answer and not worth worrying about.
So much can happen in the next 2-4 decades that none of us have 
any idea what our lives will be like individually and collectively. 
Sometimes I feel like I put a lot of pressure on myself to have 
everything figured out whether it’s financially, emotionally, or 
intellectually, but then I remember I’m only 21 and it’s ok to not be 
there.
So to answer your question, I like to hope that we’re experiencing
 what every generation experiences, and that’s a uncertainty about our 
lives because we’re still figuring out what living, growing up, and 
being a person even means. Hell, as much as our lives may be different 
than previous generations, we’re still living in a mostly “consistent” 
time period imo. Think of the difficulties people had way way before us,
 where a single rough winter could mean death for the entire family. As 
long as we don’t give up and actually work with each other to lead 
better lives, we’ll be just fine. :)
Personally I feel like I’d rather live out of spite. I used to 
always be depressed and with my ADHD I felt like my mind was always 
overthinking about every single thing it could. Now I just think “fuck 
it, I live my life the way I want and the worst that happens is I die 
like I wanted to in the past anyway.”
It's so refreshing to read a more optimistic opinion. I needed that, thanks!
I'm a millennial, so ignore me if you don't want old head perspective, but maybe this will help someone else too.
A lot of my peers went through the same shit in our late twenties 
too.  Never making plans to cause our own demise, but having the vague 
sense that if we got hit by a bus maybe it's not such a bad thing.
When we hit mid thirties, life started to stabilize.  Long term 
relationships solidified.  Promotions.  Settling in a forever city.  
Pets.  Kids.  Routine! Some sense of stability!  But these things take a
 long time to get through and it feels overwhelming when you're in your 
20s and it's all a decade away.
Our schedules got busy with maintaining the routine.  When I was 
younger I thought routines were boring.  But it's been really healthy 
for me and my friends.  Where before we were making grim jokes about 
being in the ground by 40, we're now thinking of what we might want 
retirement to look like, getting serious about getting fit enough we 
won't fall apart by 65, and making plans for things decades away.
When you get to the stable routines era, and more of the big 
things settled there's so much less pressure.  Turns out boring meansrelaxed.
  Yes, big bad stuff is happening in the world.  But in my little 
corner, in my home with my loved ones, it's pretty comfortable at this 
point.  I lock the deadbolt when I come home and I'm in my little bubble
 where for the next 12 hours I'm safe and have what I need, even if it's
 not everything I want.
In short.  I think you might like being a boring middle aged person.  And sometimes boring actually turns grim into jolly.
I hope I can get to a place where I have a solid enough income to 
enjoy this kind of life. I’m 34 and still live at home because the pay 
at my current job sucks. The company has been going gradually downhill 
ever since the owners’ son died unexpectedly because said owners don’t 
actually know how to effectively run a business. Since their son’s death
 and the pandemic, I feel like all of my marketable skills that could 
get me a better paying job have atrophied. I also have AuDHD, which 
makes building my own routines while living in a house with my parents 
who are rather unstructured in a lot of ways, particularly difficult. I 
feel stuck. I’m dating my long-time best friend now, and he’s in a 
similar position of living at home, being on the spectrum, and feeling 
stuck in his current job. If we stay together for the long haul, I hope 
that we can maybe afford a place together if we combine our incomes. I 
still don’t even know if I want kids with the state of this country (the
 U.S.). I honestly miss a lot of things about my 20s. My parents are 
well-off enough and I got enough scholarships that I don’t have student 
loan debt, and I thrived in the structure of school and doing work that I
 was passionate about. I hope I didn’t peak then. I hope I can get to a 
place of contentment as I age.
It's nice! My philosophy from how I treated myself for a long time
 now is "It's not worth it dwelling on the problems but instead try to 
either tackle em if possible or if not, just give respects and support 
however possible and just try to enjoy life! I was about to relapse in 
self loathing from a mistake I made and tried to keep under wraps bc I 
didny want others to worry but then told myself "Is it gonna do anything
 to help? No? What about knowing what I did wrong and try to improve on?
 Yes? Is this problem being resolved? Yea! It'll be okay and not the end
 of the world! Just get the problem solved and not dwell too much on it.
 It prevents myself committing to step 1 of the solving."
Life’s to short to even care at al
Yeah, it's just we're able to discuss it for once, because even discussing this in previous generations was highly taboo.
Except I do think my life will be shit when I'm 60-80.
I already have tons of health problems.
I don't want to live long enough to get dementia, cancer(at that 
age making it so if it's a survival one, it'll still make me bed ridden 
forever, Alzheimer's, etc)
Yeah no thanks
As a self diagnosed with ADHD, saying  "fuck it, we ball" and  
improvising sometimes is one of the best feelings ever. Especially when 
it works, and that isn't rare. Feels like I temporarily sever the chains
 that are holding me back.
As a fellow ADHD-er, I feel this. It’s nice to cast off that fear 
and anxiety and overwhelm for a bit and get fed up with being fed up, 
then do something that works. I wish I had more control over when I get 
that feeling.
It only goes down from here

 that platforms like tiktok have made the word suicide socially taboo to

People cant say someone dyed and are ded anymore. It's retorted.
Yes, you can. That literally only applies to Tiktok andmaybeFacebook, since the latter's automod is idiotic and there's no real way
 to appeal it. Speech is relatively free on Reddit, you just can't be 
racist, homophobic, etc nor insult. That's it. Observe:
IS is a terrorist organisation that grew in power and infamy 
during the 2010s. They killed many; hundreds of people are now dead 
because of them. That is to say, people died because of them.
Youtube started it with demonetizing videos
Speech is relatively free on Reddi
lol. maybe 15 years ago
Damn, that makes me want to kill myself!
It’s sad how many people still do this to themselves. Unless you 
actually get a warning or repercussion from using certain language, say 
what you want how you want.
It really is embarrassing diction.

[etheran123]: You can say suicide or “killing themselves”.  Self censoring for 
stupid terminally online terms just makes the discussion for what is a 
serious topic sound childish
Sorry OP but it just really bugs me when I see people online do this.
A lot of posts/comments are removed when you use any sort of 
language that’s isn’t sunshine and rainbows. Self censoring IRL is not 
necessary but online it is in many cases.
On something like TikTok, sure, but Reddit doesn't give a fuck.
If I try to search anything about suicide on google, tiktok, 
facebook, twitter I always get a warning to call for help. When I was

[Odd_Damage_3605]: A lot of posts/comments are removed when you use any sort of 
language that’s isn’t sunshine and rainbows. Self censoring IRL is not 
necessary but online it is in many cases.
On something like TikTok, sure, but Reddit doesn't give a fuck.
If I try to search anything about suicide on google, tiktok, 
facebook, twitter I always get a warning to call for help. When I was

[Flat_Transition_3775]: True! Like if my illness is terminal then time to put me to sleep.
 If we can put our animals to sleep instead of suffering, I want that 
too.
[MidwestraisedCOlady]: Everyone thinks they can just take a bunch of pills. If it was 
that easy, it would be an absolute epidemic. Find a MAID state if you 
get a life threatening illness and use the program.
It really is that easy though lol people are just scared of doing 
it. Unfortunately Illinois is not one of those states and you need to be
 a resident of that state to use the program.
I'm still 20 I still got plenty of life left to live if I make it 
all the way to old age. Just buy a gun and put it away until the day 
comes, that's what I plan on doing. You may not even have to use it if 
you die of something more normal like in your sleep or whatever.

I know the life satisfaction index tends to go up after a certain 
age, interestingly. Like when you become more chill and kind, and seeing
 flowers in a public park feels as special as visiting a world-famous 
landmark. Apprantly, people just become happier than back when were 
healthier and younger. But I'm not sure if it's an age thing or the fact
 that they don't have to work as hard anymore and they can just chill 
and be happy for once

[[deleted]]: It's already happening in some places. Everyone knows the suicide 
rate in South Korea is high. What many dont tell you is that these are 
mostly elders who can't make a living anymore and take what they 
perceive as the only way out/to not be a burden on family and or society
 in general
I hope for those who desire to “go out” there, that elder 
voluntary euthanasia is legal instead of dying in a painful way alone

[GreyWolf_93]: The Remington retirement has long been a western favourite.
But from a quality of life standpoint, if you are working to live 
and no longer have the means or strength or mobility to live what little
 life you’ve got left, I can’t fault someone for choosing the easy way 
out.
Provided of course, you have no dependants.
[Far-Masterpiece8101]: My retirement plan is to have enough heroin and benzos to go all out when I'm terminally ill
I'd like to try heroin one day when I have nothing to lose. ODing 
on euphoric downers seems preferable to dying is hospice care or a 
suicide pod
Yup.  That’s my plan, i have that terminal disease and will be useless in under 3 years.
I'm sorry to hear that and I don't want to be a bad influence. Try to be yourself for as long as possible anyway
I don't know what else to say because that's so unfortunate for a young person. God bless you

[Mysterious_Bag_9061]: Not to be just as dark as you but I've never intended to get old, 
and since working with the frail elderly in nursing homes for the past 
10 years, I especially don't intend to make it into one. 50-70  is it 
for me, depending on the general state of my health at the time.

Oh! I see what you mean. Yeah I mean I think people have been 
offing themselves to get away from financial woes forever. I can

improve material conditions for the working class. I

[SimilarLunch8359]: The unabomber knew it all along
[doesnotexist2]: Interesting theory
While I don’t think it will be “the norm”, I do think suicide will
 be much more accepted. People will be much more accepting of others 
simply saying “I’m done with this, I no long want to live this life”.
But also, there is no telling what the future holds. We could see 
another baby boom after another world war, or we could see the world 
population decrease after another plague (much worse than covid). Nobody
 knows.
The only thing you can do is take it one day at a time and have as much fun as you can.
[TheCitizenXane]: Typical American without universal healthcare be like:
Nope, I'm Russian and I live in Europe. Healthcare is very decent 
where I live, but it the heathcare system has become so much worse than 
it was 10 years ago, so I have a hard time believing it will be viable 
by the time we grow old, especially since there will be many old folks 
and not many young people.
And current systems will fall apart within our lifetimes as 
birthrates are falling and not enough young people are being born and 
eventually entering the workforce. I've heard that this could happen in 
the next 10-20y for Japan and South Korea.
The boy you're responding to is severely online. He's also, like 
all good anti-American online tankies, hilariously U.S.-centric.

[Competitive_Let6665]: I might be wrong but I believe most male suicides are currently of
 men between age 40-45 so this is not unique to Gen Z.  We are all 
feeling so burnt out at every generation. We need to move away from 
fundamentalist capitalism in my opinion.
[[deleted]]: I would disagree with you. I think a lot of burnout we are feeling
 is imposed on us from older generations being used to working their 
tails off. When we are that old, we will be one of the oldest 
generations left, so really we get to set the standard for the younger 
generations. I think we'll change how society views depression and burn 
out, and it'll be taken more seriously.
Good point
[VolgaOsetr8007]: Good point
[Ok_Chocolate_3480]: I understand all the things you have tried to explain but I still 
feel you are seriously underestimating the desire in people to live and 
the fear of death. By using your logic there are literally many 
countries where this phenomenon should be happening right now but it is 
not.
[Serial_Psychosis]: Just say suicide, there's no need to censor yourself.  I plan on 
living up the good life when I'm 60+.  Traveling and relaxing.
I think everyone does, but there is only a tiny fraction of people who will be actually able to do it.

[Henry-1917]: Say suicide. Stop using this TikTok slang
[MacaroonFancy757]: We need to revolt against this system. Unfortunately, it will never happen
[Kwopp]: Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t suicide pretty prevalent among 
old people already? I definitely agree it’s going to be worse when we 
get to that age though.
[zachbohemian]: man fuck the American dream, it isn't real. It's just a Ponzi 
scheme that was sold to us so the rich could get richer. live as you 
choose or the best you can, my dream is to live in a bus on a plot of 
land where I'll homestead with other folks where I'll raise kids if I 
able. if not, oh well. make the best of it instead of trying to live up 
to a artificial dream that's made for us when we should know life is 
never planned, it's unpredictable. trying to act like life is this 
status quo instead of doing what you want and being grateful for what 
you have is why so many go crazy when things don't go to plan for the 
sake of chasing imo. people should rise up and telling these 
billionaires to fuck off instead of being sycophants. we might not 
retire, we not own a house like our parents did or a stable career but 
it's only gonna get worse if we let the elites have their way. they'll 
put distractions in our face saying immigrants are the problem or some 
skibidi toilet bullshit but we shouldn't stand for any of it. we 
shouldn't be offing ourselves, what we should be doing rise the fuck up
[ALargeRubberDuck]: This is actually already true of the elderly,
Among males, the suicide rate was highest for those age 75 and older (43.9 per 100,000).

Thanks for sharing the stats, it’s actually very informative! My

[SlavaAmericana]: I think a lot of people dont understand is that there comes a 
point in one's life where you dont desire to be the main character 
anymore and will prefer to live through your relationships with other 
people as a supporting character. Getting old with out a family and 
without a multi generational community is going to be a lot harder than 
being young without these things.
[TinyHeartSyndrome]: I believe we should have medical euthanasia for terminal conditions. Not everyone wants to fight cancer for 10 years, etc.
Yes, I hope it'll be more commonplace in the future as society continues to value death with dignity as a concept.

[ninjasowner14]: Think of what happened in the last 20 year. Xbox 360 just came out, the wii came out in novemeber of 2006...
Flip phones were the only thing. More box television than not. I 
dont even think Youtube was a thing yet(Or just in its infancy).
The amount of opportunity that is available is incredible, the 
increase of tech has been phenomenal, and the next 20-60 years should be
 even more crazy(if we dont end up nuking the planet).
Just got to make sure that you improve/learn one thing a day, be 
grateful for everything, and make the most of it. If you dont, you can 
cry easily with how shit the world has become...
Technology destroyed this world not improved it
[New-Eagle-8349]: Technology destroyed this world not improved it
[OnlyActuary2595]: I think so too, it is a heavy topic to think about but you see old
 gen people fight for those extra moments during their late age so they 
can retire from the workplace and enjoy the world and its perks, spend 
time with family, kids even grand kids. But with situations we have is 
totally different where if we are here and don’t have any plans for 
emergency or retirement, we are a burden and many people would tend to 
give up out of not being a homeless at the end or it is the easier way
[WildFemmeFatale]: I’d rather die that go to a nursing home
I’ve been inside them cuz I’ve had family members who worked there
 and the stories they tell about residents smearing shit on walls, 
peeing and pooping their pants, constantly screaming, and constantly 
getting sick or bed bugs or scabies—
I would rather die than go to a nursing home, especially if I 
develop dementia. Dementia patients on the severe scale can become very 
scary and hurtful, I’d hate to scare/hurt my family by becoming an 
involuntarily mean person due to dementia
No nursing home for me, my retirement plan is death lol probably around age 70 I guess
[Eastern-Job3263]: This feels like it was written in Chat GPT, which makes this post much more dark, honestly.
[Zealousideal_Slice60]: OP, call it ‘suicide’ and not ‘unaliving’, this isn’t tiktok so you don’t have to censor yourself
[Moonscape6223]: I can imagine that. There's also a pretty good chance that we 
won't have much of a choice on the matter; considering the birth rate 
crisis, if we don't get enough immigrants, it might essentially force 
the government (or corporations) to begin institutionalised senicide to 
avoid collapse
[MajesticBread9147]: It's already a thing.
The congressional report entitledLong-Term Trends in Deaths of Despairin which deaths of despair are categorized as a combination of deaths 
from suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol noted that these were at 100 
year highs. And this report came out the yearbeforeCovid. 
This was largely driven by deaths from those in middle age and older, 
and is a huge reason that America's life expectancy peaked about 10 
years ago.
[bongslingingninja]: AI slop 🤮
[NotLunaris]: unironic use of "unalive"
Tiktok brainrot
[Danthrax81]: It may very well be a population correction, which, through some turmoil, may reverse the social forces at play.
We as humans like to think we're special, but we are still animals and tend to boom-bust ourselves as a species.
There are countless stories of generations that had life pretty 
rough before a revolution or a pivotal change.  We just have more toys 
now
[dedicatedoni]: 1000% I see some of the most miserable and lonely people ranging 
from teens to young adults and it genuinely worries me to see what 
they’ll do in life when the responsibility of being an adult is placed 
on their shoulders
[Studio_Kamio]: 100% will be a thing within our lifetimes, though I think it’ll 
happen before our generation gets there. We’ll be the tipping point that
 marks it as “common”
[Altruistic-Cat-4193]: Just say suicide.
Cause "unalliveing" just down play the seriousness of it
[Crafty_Maybe_1859]: By the time we hit 55, 60, 70 those dinosaurs that made these laws
 and our generation inevitable to live in are going to be dead. We have a
 voice today to do what’s right for our futures. We cannot forget.
[playgirl1312]: Hate to break it to you, but that's always been a thing.
[Vic_Vega_MrB]: I don't have any hope for a generation that  invented the word 
"unalived" embraces the stupidity of censorship 50 years after George 
Carlin exposed it in the famousSeven Dirty Wordscomedy routine/statement.
[Ok_Cardiologist3642]: definitely. my husband already talked about immigrating to the 
netherlands where euthanasia is legal once we're old. I think it can be a
 good thing for a lot of people, knowing that you have the option to 
have a painful and fearless death, of course this is only available to a
 certain demographic like chronically ill etc. dying with dignity and 
when you know you're in good hands must be so peaceful, especially if 
you know that your death will be miserable otherwise
[curtiss_mac]: I feel like with the way we are headed, there will be a record # 
of cancers our generation will be dealing with once we get older. Think;
 all the shit foods, shit environment, not a lot of people are actually 
taking care of themselves thinking long term. Also with the direction we
 are headed, getting healthcare or treatment for those cancers will be 
more and more expensive every year, meaning killing ourselves will be 
the only way.
Add on the fact that our retirements are literally being spent for us before we even get close to that age.

TÍTULO: Socially burnt out? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I’m at a point where I feel like I truly am burnt out with society
 and searching for the “traditional” path. When I was young I was taught
 that to be successful you needed a college degree, friends, 
relationship and a high paying corporate job. So I did what was 
prescribed and it has lead to nothing but frustration and misery.
Friends are 80% of the time fair weather and really there for you 
if it’s something minor. I spent years killing myself for my friends 
driving them around and never asking for gas money, paying for the 
outings when they were low with money, and listening to their problems.
Same with relationships, things start out great and exciting at 
first, and being grateful I feel like I try my best to make them work, 
but it either fizzles out despite my best efforts.
I feel like college was the biggest dupe: I spent a lot of money 
on my degrees thinking it would land me a cushy job, well I got a 
corporate job and I feel more restricted than ever. So much 
“professionalism” and the incessant stupid corporate fucking lingo and 
fake smiles. I should’ve just went into the military where you kiss as 
much ass as you do here but at least you can retire later with good 
benefits. Working a corporate job is very similar to the military in my 
opinion both “own” you and your time but only one actually gives you 
lifelong tangible benefits.
I had a mini vacation, where all I did was walking around the 
city, hang out at the local coffee shops and go off into the forest and 
roam nature and it was the most peaceful I ever felt. Honestly at this 
point I feel like I’d rather live in a log cabin in the woods now.
I can’t even take the media and television seriously anymore. I 
literally call my tv the fairy tale box now. All it does is show you 
things you can’t have and things you can’t enjoy, just delusions that 
fill your head and give you fake dreams.
Honestly I don’t even care about friends, relationships, money or 
status anymore. At this point I’d rather just work to pay my bills. I 
feel burnt out and feel that the American paradigm of hustling and 
grinding and indulging in baccanalia isn’t for me.

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
School makes your remember mostly useless information, exposes you
 to bullying from students and teachers alike, takes away your free time
 and more. If you're bullied, you're victime blamed by teachers.
No employer gives homework to their employees. No adult, proper 
police officer, proper investigator or proper court judge victim blames 
the victims of crimes.
Boomer and GenX parents are fucking strict. You did your chores? 
Bad! You talk back! Whooping! You use your phone? Grounded! You sleep? 
Wake the fuck up!
The worst thing is, nobody takes kids and teenagers seriously. 
Adults take serious action only when things get serious, but it's 
already too late. When a teacher or school principal abuses students, 
nobody believes students. When a parent abuses kids, no one believes 
kids until it's too late. In the worst case, kids have destroyed mental 
health and/or are seriously injured and/or dead.
Nobody in the real world spanks an adult in a job for doing 
something wrong like wiping down floors wrong or not doing something. 
Nobody in a job says ma'am/sir but refers to each other per you and 
calls each other by name. However, adults require children to talk to 
them as if they were their master.
Nobody cares if adults break some child protection laws or school laws, nobody will believe a kid or a teenager anyway.
This makes children believe the world is always unfair. For 
example, by collective punishments for things a few people did.
Everywhere you go, kids are unwelcome. If you go out and you go to
 a playground, boomers will look at you from their homes and cars and 
scream and/or call police on you. No wonder kids are on their phones, 
tablets, TVs and game consoles if the outside lacks playgrounds, parks, 
safe sidewalks and neighbourhoods and everytime kids go outside, they 
get screamed at, called the police on, get watched, etc. Sports fields 
and playgrounds are closed, benches in parks removed or get spikes added
 to fight homelessness and skateboarding, cars are getting heavier and 
faster, contributing to a rise in pedestrian deaths.We won't raise our kids to be independent in such neighbourhoods.We won't raise our kids in the suburbia.Those boomers and GenXers who built the car centric suburbia have the audacity to ask why kids don't play outside anymore?
Kids in restaurants, public transportation, offices and in public 
in general are considered like adults who can't behave. Relax, it's a 
child, it has a right to make mistakes. Some chains stores ban 
unsupervised kids and teenagers.
Expressing your opinion and/or concerns is considered rude and 
talking back. No adult would consider another adult's opinion rude 
and/or concerns talking back. When you complain about anything, you're 
given a rant and a fairy tale about how childhood is the best part of 
your life.
No political party takes the wellbeing of kids and teenagers in school and anywhere else seriously.
How society makes having kids a living hell? Simple:
Renting or owning a home takes half of your paycheck.
You have to wait for years to see a doctor. It's even worse when it comes to mental health.
You can't find a good job. Either you work in a Januszex where 
labor laws aren't respected, overtime is unpaid and you often work 
without a contract of employment or you work under a junk contract. Or 
you overwork yourself to death in a corpo.
Public transportation is shitty and pretty much nonexistent outside major cities.
If you want your child to go to nursery and kindergarten, then 
wait 300 places in line, or spend even more on private nursery.
If you want your child to be educated, too bad. He'll have to 
memorize shittons of unnecessary stuff and be bullied by teachers and 
students, when he reports that he'll be blamed too. Stress, depression, 
burnout and so on guaranteed. It's even worse when you go to college.
If your fetus has some complications that threaten its and even 
your life, too bad. I hope you have a couple kilos for a trip to nearby 
countries that allow abortion (but you probably don't).
And climate change, ecosystem collapse, capitalism and new 
technologies like AI and biotech. They all make future look grim and 
hopeless.
Parents are also exhausted by societal expectations. Women are 
expected to be independent and work, while still taking care of the 
kids. Fathers share housework and childcare more equally, but are still 
expected to mostly work and be the family's main income.
Why is this a problem?
They require constant population growth or at least staying the 
same. If you can't have that, you need a demographic peak once a few 
generations.
More old people means skyrocketing healthcare and elder care 
costs. Working adults would have to work even more for less. The 
financial burden would be insane.
Those older people would also elect people who favor them and 
wealth over climate change mitigation, cost of living crisis mitigation 
and other leftist policies.
Kids need to stop being treated like objects, but as actual 
humans. They need to be listened to, and school laws as well as other 
laws protecting then need to be strengthened. Neighbourhoods need to be 
redesigned to include playgrounds and sports fields, and to be green and
 walkable and bikeable and transit oriented. Cars need to get lighter 
and in cities they need to be slowed down, and they need to get slowed 
down even more near schools and parks.
Children in public spaces need to be accepted. People need to realize children are a vital part of society.
Schools need to have shorter days, no homework, and actually help 
bullies and the bullied. Those with mental problems and 
neurodevelopmental disorders need to get help and be treated as humans.
When it comes to having kids,
We need massive public housing programs, free and universal 
childcare, healthcare, education and transportation as well as financial
 incentives for parents and better wages and 4 hour work days and 4 day 
work weeks. Not800+for every child, but real incentives.

They might. I also hope they can preserve their mental health.
I remember feeling exactly like this at 14 and we didn't even have
 reddit, the internet was something no one had at home. But we, people 
and kids who did some work to inform ourselves, we knew. We knew of 
climate change, we quickly noticed all these issues around us, and this 
crowd of adults seemingly doing absolutely nothing about it.
There's a lot to be said about all of this but I really do get

the terminally online kid, he'll figure it out one day" tribe.
What I said was just to comedic effect. I bet we’ve all felt like 
this at one point, seeing the absolute apathy of the people older than 
you and feeling like you’re the only one who gives a shit.
I miss being as optimistic, feeling like I could tackle all the 
world's injustices at once, and like I said, I hope this kid keeps up 
the fight and balances it out so they don’t burn out and fall into the 
same apathy that’s claimed countless people before and after him.
Edit: Perceived Apathy I should say not that every single person is apathetic to the goings on of the world
[Ethicaldreamer]: They might. I also hope they can preserve their mental health.
I remember feeling exactly like this at 14 and we didn't even have
 reddit, the internet was something no one had at home. But we, people 
and kids who did some work to inform ourselves, we knew. We knew of 
climate change, we quickly noticed all these issues around us, and this 
crowd of adults seemingly doing absolutely nothing about it.

[Arndt3002]: Lol, being "aware" doesn't solve the problem. Everyone can 
identify the problem. The only ones that matter are those who have the 
skill and knowledge to try and solve them.
Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.
Exactly. Just getting people to talk about solutions is difficult.
Everyone can identify the problems. Few actually look for solutions.
While talking about problems has it's place, does anyone need to 
be told that prices are high 1000 more times? We already know it. Saying
 it over and over does nothing to help anything and if anything just 
makes people feel even more helpless.
What we need to do is actually start talking about solutions and plans for how to achieve them.
The reason why Biden is canceling student debt is because that has been a popular proposal for a while now.
A lot of the issues that OP talks about are local problems where people actually have the ability to have the most impact.
Getting more control over school districts, stricter enforcement 
of child safety laws, making cities more walkable, all addressable at 
the city government level.
Hell if enough kids realize what's up and work together, they 
could organize to take over city councils and start enacting changes 
rapidly. Then if they have success their solutions could be copied by 
other cities and spread across the country.
As an older person, I'm all for it. The question is, are they?

[[deleted]]: You're acting like he can do much else at 14 besides write a reddit post.
[unimportantop]: You're immediately dismissing him based on age under his argument 
no one takes kids seriously? Honestly, who's really lacking in brain 
development here.
I'm 23, and everything he says here is right, even if to some 
extent he's copying opinions he found online. But plenty if not most 
grown adults do that.
Physical and sexual abuse are made far worse by people who don't take kids seriously and see it as "horomones."
Facts. I'm the same age and it's a great thing we aren't 
undermining the youth just because of their age range. Idk why the 
boomers and their offspring needed to fuck everything up and act like 
they're some box of wisdom for spouting basic and mundane horseshit.

[[deleted]]: Breh im just imagining my boss spanking my ass for not doing my 
job good enough😂😂😂 but seriously I’m not raising a family in this 
shit. Public schools are just as useless as college. Sitting here with a
 bachelors in a field that has the highest layoff rate in the country 
atm after pushing everyone towards the industry. The housing market is 
in fact fucked atm and I know at least 40 out of the 60 in my college 
classes are not working in the fields they studied for. Even trades 
workers I know are already experiencing burnout due to the cost of 
living.
With that being said this kid is just experiencing what it’s like 
to be oppressed by their authority figures around them. When I 
experienced this I was already a metal head and didn’t give a fuck but 
meh.
[[deleted]]: Just proved OP's point. Fuck off.
[Who_am_ey3]: yeah, this kid is getting all of "his" opinions from reddit, and it shows.
[RaveDadRolls]: This is the only comment that makes sense. The whole thing feels 
like it's written by someone who has absolutely no idea how tbe world 
works.
OP - do your homework and chores. It's preparing you to do your 
work as an adult. And no you won't get punished or beat - You'll just 
get fired and be homeless. There are things worse than getting your 
screen time taken away bud
[LadyTwiggle]: I mean, 14 or not the kid comes at you with some serious perhaps 
heavy shit and your first instinct is to put them down like that?
I'm 30 and I agree with the kid. The world isn't set up for 
children, especially teens. More and more people are becoming child-free
 and/or jaded. Less people are having babies and there will be 
consequences for that, likely for Gen Z or Alpha.
Being and Adult is better than being a child tho. Mainly because 
you have more control over your own life and circumstances.

[BaseballSeveral1107]: Your should get them a smartphone. In case of an emergency they 
can contact somebody. Not to mention the stigma of not having a phone 
while everyone else does
This isn’t meant as an insult but I genuinely think you would 
benefit from therapy if that’s an option for you.  Your rant seems to be
 filled with pain and it’s not reflective of what most kids experience 
even though you think it is.  Being an older millennial I have the life 
perspective to recognize that there has never been a generation more 
comfortable talking about anxiety, depression, mental illness, etc. than
 yours.  There are a lot of resources out there but you have to pursue 
them.  I grew up getting physically bullied on multiple occasions 
especially in high school, I had a lot of really bad experiences growing
 up including my high school girlfriend of two years going missing 
(she’s presumed dead but no one knows for sure) I had grown men try to 
drag me out of my car and beat me for “being gay” when I was 16, all of 
this lead to me having GAD and no one to talk to / help me.  All of that
 being said, I have a good life now- I work with at risk youth, was 
finally able to buy a car and a house and am enjoying my life for once. 
 My point is- you can get through this, and there’s people out there who
 can help you.  I don’t know your situation exactly and don’t presume 
to, but just recognize that things can always be worse and there are 
resources out there where you can get help.

[MeddlingHyacinth]: Activist in the making. Love it. Great post BTW, you are pretty much spot on. Don't let anyone try to dismiss you.
Love all the people just calling them "terminally online" etc. 
Sure being on reddit can bring these points up a lot, doesn't mean they 
aren't true. Just because someone has had decent teacher or parents, 
doesn't mean everyone else has too. Some people go through abuse for 
every step of the way.
Agreed. Also it's hilarious these people calling him/her 
terminally online are trying to argue and tear down a CHILD for having 
opinions online. Like... maybe these mfs need to touch grass.

[That_Stray_Scout_]: All the top comments are proof of everything op said, the older 
generation/redditors feelings got hurt because they have to face the 
reality they have made for us. They wanted to be better, they wanted the
 best, but now all the work they have put in means nothing and has 
destroyed us. THEY BLAME US, for something we never had a say in.
Never stop calling out their faults op, Thanks for posting
Yeah you can smell the butthurt from miles away
[Ethicaldreamer]: Yeah you can smell the butthurt from miles away
[tutike2000]: All these comments just proving you right. Boomers and gen x are a
 cancer on this Earth and I can't wait for them to die out and become 
irrelevant.
Although that being said, you need to adapt to the situation you 
find yourself in. No amount of reddit posts will convince the olds 
they've done something wrong.
Oh boy...wait until Gen z becomes 40 year olds and Gen alpha plays reverse uno on you guys.
Can we ever get past Gen blaming? Why do we do this to ourselves?
Yeah. Honestly, looking at every single past generation, the new 
generations find a way to say that the last screwed them over. We’re 
literally only a couple generations out from improved mental healthcare.
 A majority of Gen X parents are damaged from painful childhoods. 
Hopefully Gen Z can be the ones to stop that cycle of abuse
Exactly this. LOL
Let's hope gen z and millennial can do better. And I hope gen 
alpha can survive their frontal lobes being obliterated by iPads and 
tiktok
Wait so you are waiting for your grandparents to die out? I feel 
bad for them and your parents for raising you if that’s what you 
believe.

[[deleted]]: To be fair dude, kids and teenagers are fucking stupid. I was 
fucking stupid. I’m still fucking stupid, just less-stupid enough to 
realize just how fucking stupid I was. 12 year old me would’ve 
absolutely gotten a tattoo of my Roblox persona smoking a blunt. And 
this was OG Roblox too motherfuckers, when it was still all blocks. 
There’s a reason undeveloped brains aren’t taken TOO seriously. Yeah. 23
 year old me got a frog smoking a blunt on my arm for the world to see 
instead. Much more respectable.
But I partly agree, I feel bad for kids growing up today. What a 
doomed fucking world to be brought up in. Not necessarily because of all
 that - your points are over-dramatic and exaggerated but with some 
truth to them. Abundance and yet completely directionless existence. My 
generation is grown up now and yet most of us can’t manage. Every 
generation has its issues, at least there’s not much war or famine, at 
least we HAVE an education and don’t die from stepping on rusty nails 
and chicken shit. But the mental burden of being a young person in the 
2020’s is incredibly heavy. I shudder to think how Gen A will turn out 
in this environment.
Not all kids and teenagers are stupid and that’s kinda of the problem I’m having with the attitudes here.
I may not have had fully formed opinions at that point but I definitely was grasping with realities of life at the time.
I agree with this. Sure I've had stupid moments, blips in my intelligence, but I've always been told I was a smart kid
Truth. Idk what's with society taking a shit on children's 
intelligence just because they're young. I am 23-years-old and for years
 I've always heard some children say interesting shit that even a person
 like myself never thought about at all. You'd be surprised how well put
 together some youth cam be over the adults who act like they're some 
box of wisdom over spouting basic and mundane horseshit.

[_sunshower_]: OP your observations are all correct but I think you should focus on how you want to channel this energy
This is so true. Focus on only the things you can have an impact 
on, don't carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.
[LostinEvergarden]: This is so true. Focus on only the things you can have an impact

[ravencircles]: Yep, never having kids! You’ve got it all. All these people in here dismissing you are just proving your point 😅
[crystalw4ves]: Wow. The comments are really just proving this kid's points. The 
disrespect for the valid feelings and concerns that this individual has 
is ridiculous. OP, while I was 14 a good while ago, I hear you and I get
 you. I think people calling this sort of discussion or rant 
"chronically online" are not listening and are possibly detatched from 
the current situation of the world, economy, politics, etc. Everyones 
experience is different, so let's try to meet eachother in the middle. 
Not everything is bad and not everything is good. Although depending on 
where you stand or how your life is going it may seem to only fit on one
 side of that spectrum. Also, OP this is a GREAT outlet for your 
emotions, your energy, and your struggles. Keep writing. Never stop. No 
matter what critics or what anyone says. You're a smart, thinking kid. 
That's more than I can say about most adults nowadays (proven by 
comments).

[Impressive_Heron_897]: Half true, half rant. Run for politics if you want to make 
changes. If you want to be taken seriously, don't say silly things.
Two things:
1: No one likes to hear it, especially kids, but it often could be
 a lot worse. At least kids get to go to school where you are. In a lot 
of human history, and current parts of the world, boys your age are 
working full time labor jobs (or being drafted into Jihadist groups or 
gangs), and girls don't even to go to school; they'd be pregnant and 
married by 14-18.
2: Democracy is far from perfect, the alternatives are just worse.
 There's a path to making your community better, or you can just set 
yourself up for an adulthood that doesn't require interaction. Get a HS 
degree full of "worthless knowledge". Go to your local community college
 on the cheap and become a forest ranger. Go walk around in the woods 
making 40k with decent healthcare and ignore society. Or stick it out 
and try to make it better.

Yes, all the people have more power than apolitician. 
But one citizen has less power to make change than say, a governor. OP 
is enraged about education for all the wrong reasons, but if they want 
to help run for state politics and make changes.
Or just rant. Up to them. Most kids choose rant because it's a lot less work.

[Creepy_Philosopher_9]: I don't know why people are being mean to you in the comments, you are absolutely right on every point.
Maybe they are all salty for being called out?
[pdoxgamer]: Sending warm vibes your way my dude.
And fwiw, I'd recommend you move to a beautiful walkable city like
 I did once you're older. Life is much more active in a dense city, a 
plethora of options. Larger swath of job opportunities as well. Many 
more different types of people you meet too. Hang in there, get a decent
 degree, and carve out a decent life for yourself in a decent place!
[SexxxyWesky]: There is a lot to unpack here, but a lot of this seems like you’re
 just young. Especially your part about school teaching you useless 
things and employers not giving homework. A lot of this is chronically 
online as well.
I agree on some aspects, but a lot of this screams young/immature and with little life experience.

[No_Blackberry_6286]: After reading all the comments on here, it's sad to see how far downhill society has gotten.
I thought they were about my age (23) or a little older and were 
involved with kids somehow (teacher, babysitter....possibly parent), and
 I saw in other comments that OP is 14 years old.
I think they bring up some valid points, and anyone who is 
disregarding what they have to say might not be a good person at heart 
because you are making what OP has to say more true.
I fully intend to listen to my nieces and nephew and try to 
understand them. Kids are people, too. They have emotions. They need 
love and support.
Agreed. It's absolutely insane reading these butthurt-ass comments
 from older people. I'm literally scrolling through trying to figure out
 why exactly these idiots are so pompous. Entitlement is so easy to 
point out when someone has a rough experience and decides to rant. These
 responses are absolute bullshit. Kids having feelings, they have the 
ability to look at the world around them. And like you said, I agree 
they need love and support especially when they're suffering.

[mama_rabes]: I love these comments about how this 14(?) year old need to touch 
grass and not at all about the struggle being portrayed. Do people not 
see they are proving the point? Even if it’s true that this person has 
spent too much time online, should we not at least emphasize?

[Destructive2DezEndz]: If you ever read a diary entry from someone born in 1924, or 1944,
 or 1974 or 1994, you'll realized you share the same thoughts as they 
do.
You mention a lot of bad things, but you don't mention the good things about the bad things.
For example, yes I agree with you that in school you have to 
memorize a lot of useless things, but you learn useful things like 
learning how to read, do basic math, and you get the opportunity to see 
your friends every day. After you are finished with school, nobody 
teaches you anything, and you won't have time to see your friends 
because they will be just as busy as you are.
When you say "Nobody in the real world spanks an adult for doing 
something wrong or not doing something" I must disagree with you and 
inform you that people who break laws have worst things happen to them. 
Even if you didn't know the law and break it, people with guns will come
 to your house, beat you up and drag you out and put you in a box for 
several years, and sell all your things and leave you with nothing. I 
must rather get a spanking than that.
When you say, "We need massive public housing programs, free and 
universal childcare, healthcare, education and transportation as well as
 financial incentives for parents and better wages and 4 hour work days 
and 4 day work weeks." That was tried before in some countries, and 
millions of people starved to death because of an administrative error. 
It's not a good idea. It's better for people to take care of themselves 
instead of having people take care of people.
[obi_wan_sosig]: First off
Things ARE getting better. Bit by bit.
Op, touch grass
[Veganchiggennugget]: Yeah I ain’t having kids..
[N3xuskn1ght]: I'm only 4 years older than this person, but they make some good points
[WC1-Stretch]: "No employer gives homework to their employees"
Sorry my guy, but "exempt" is a VERY large classification of 
salaried workers in the US -- and what they're exempt from is pay for 
homework (called "overtime" in the professional world)
[[deleted]]: Human beings man are geniuses at finding overly complex ways of 
doing stupid shit when the answers for our problems are easy. But that 
takes honesty and self reflection.   Most people's problems on the first
 world are brought on themselves.
[Xerxes0]: Adults are shitty to each other all the time. Do they spank you 
for doing a bad job? No, because that's assault and they'll go to 
prison. Instead they fire you and take away your income (thus your 
ability to pay for housing, food, bills, etc.). When you're an adult 
corporal punishment doesn't work the same way economic punishment does.
Furthermore, there can be intense victim-blaming in courts of law,
 especially when dealing with very sensitive crimes such as rape and 
sexual assault (E.g. "she was asking for it by dressing like that"). 
Adults can be overbearing and abusive towards kids, this is true and 
there is no doubt about it, but they can be outright hostile and 
aggressive towards other adults if they think they can gain something 
from you.
I hear you and I understand your frustrations. It's extremely 
difficult to grow up knowing your are essentially living in the "fall of
 Rome." But what are you going to do to help fix it? Get involved in 
your community. Find local political organizations which can allow you 
to protests or help come up with solutions to the problems you see in 
your community. If there's one thing adults (typically) do better than 
kids, it is that they can plan for a future goal and take small steps 
overtime to achieve this. They study, plan, and then execute their 
goals.
Learn how to do this yourself to make the changes you want to see.
 How much would massive public housing programs cost? Where would they 
be built? Who would pay for them? Who would build them? How do you 
decide the criteria of who gets to move into them? How do you plan to 
maintain them over years? If you can draft a fully thought out plan 
addressing your goals, and work with the right groups of people who can 
help elevate these goals to larger stage, then you can work towards 
achieving them.
[Optimal-Island-5846]: School isn’t mostly useless information, you just don’t like learning.
The best way to get taken seriously is not to say stupid shit like that. It’s fine if school isn’t for you.
[Stayhumblefriends]: Lol. Someone got detention in school
[AliceHart7]: WOW! YES to everything you just said!
[RichFoot2073]: “Kids grow up and think the world is unfair.”
Half correct.
The world is neither fair nor unfair, it just does not give a shit about you.
[Xcyronus]: Im basically online 24/7. And I read this and went "What in the 
fuck did I just read". My guy or whatever. While you did make some good 
points. Please get off of reddit and twitter for at least 4 more years.
[Kawaii_Nyan]: Ngl tldr but you got it rough💀 I go to a decent school with 
decent staff and left my dads house to live with my mom full time bc he 
and his wife were the abusive for no reason type. Like why are you mad 
at me and blaming for everything 24/7 when I am just existing
[ruben1252]: No individual person can fix all of the world’s problems. Help out
 in your community and do what’s in your power to make the world a 
better place, no matter how small or insignificant it might feel. That’s
 all you can do
[turtle7875]: “Bedtimes are fascist” vibes
[LongingForYesterweek]: “No employer gives homework to their employees”
Homie have you ever heard of salaried employees under a deadline? Or doctors?
[[deleted]]: Stopped ready at “No employer gives homework”
[PsychologicalRip8798]: Pretty much But unfortunately it's the best of all possible 
worlds. At any other time in Hominids existence most of us would already
 be dead and those that lived would exist in a world of death , disease ,
 superstition and interminable war. Go read a history book about 
literally any time frame until the mid 20th century and see what's up . 
In fact , the majority of planet earth still live in a pretty messed up 
reality , it's just that some white western countries don't. So all in 
all , although what you mention certainly sucks,.we have it fairly good 
on balance.

--- DOCUMENTO: Stop Guilt-Tripping Gen Z (and other coworkers without kids) Into Covering for Coworkers with Kids _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: Stop Guilt-Tripping Gen Z (and other coworkers without kids) Into Covering for Coworkers with Kids : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Can we talk about how “covering for a coworker with kids” has 
become the default expectation in so many workplaces? Like somehow being
 without kids means our time is automatically less valuable?
I didn’t sign up to be the backup parent. I’m not the emergency 
childcare system. I’m not staying late or giving up my weekends and/or 
holidays because someone else chose to have kids. That was their life 
decision, not mine. Gen Z is already navigating underpaid jobs, 
skyrocketing rent, mental health struggles, and burnout. We shouldn’t 
also be expected to quietly absorb the workload of coworkers who leave 
early for daycare/school pickup or call out every time their kid 
sneezes. I get that parenting is hard. But that doesn’t mean the rest of
 us exist to plug the gaps.
I’ve noticed growing trend of people with kids expecting those who
 do not have any kids (mostly Gen Z because we are so young but also 
childfree people from all other generations in the workforce) to pick up
 their slack, work holidays, and cover them whenever their obligations 
as a parent interfere with their career. Why is it always assumed that 
our time is less valuable? Why is our holidays time and time with our 
families seen as less valuable just because we didn’t reproduce? It’s 
discriminatory and demeaning as hell.
Boundaries aren’t selfish, they’re survival. If someone’s life is 
incompatible with their job, the solution shouldn’t be their coworkers 
who are without kids doing two jobs for the price of one or working 
extra without the pay to show for it. Normalize saying “No, I’m not 
available” without guilt or explanation. We owe them nothing. And 
normalize employers staffing their teams properly instead of relying on 
guilt-ridden Gen Z workers to pick up the slack.
Childfree ≠ more disposable.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[la_selena]: go post this on their subreddits too lol
I should honestly lol
[rabbit33333333]: I should honestly lol
[burgerking351]: I just lie and say that I’m the primary caretaker for my elderly father. They normally leave you alone after that.
[thatscringee]: This seems like such a non-issue. Just say no.
Honestly you’d be surprised, it’s a systemic issue and I’ve seen 
parents throw full blown fits over it as if they are entitled to other 
people’s time.
And? Just say you can’t.
This^ I don't mind helping someone out occasionally, but if I 
already have plans or simply don't want to, I don't. If they get upset 
about it, that's their problem.

[Slibye]: POV: when you are a parent that can’t manage your own time at a 
shitty job while gaslighting your co-worker to take your shift despite 
having plenty of chances to talk to the manager to fix your schedule
[Anon-Sham]: It just depends what sort of person you want to be. If you want to
 be a decent, helpful person, you can be as accommodating as you can 
until you start to feel like you're being exploited.
If you don't care about helping other people, don't.
I am a guy in his mid 30s with 2 young kids, I've never needed any
 help from co-workers, have always been able to sort everything out 
between myself and my wife.
But when I was in my 20s, I'd never put my name in for leave over 
the holidays. Sure, it would have been nice to enjoy the holidays stress
 free, but knowing how much that time means to kids made it an easy 
sacrifice for me to offer up to people who had kids.
From my experience, the best workplace cultures have all had a lot
 of give and take. If you feel that it's all give and no take, maybe you
 need to find a new job. Otherwise, do your best to contribute to the 
sort of culture you want to work in.
While I respect your experience, the issue is about the 
expectation that people without kids should absorb the burdens of those 
who chose to have them. The narrative that parents deserve special 
treatment just because “kids matter more” creates an unfair dynamic 
where childfree coworkers (mainly Gen Z) are quietly penalized for 
simply existing differently.
You said you and your wife have always managed without needing 
help. That’s great and exactly how it should be because expecting other 
people who’ve made different choices to pick up slack is unfair. 
However, not everyone with kids operates that way. Many do expect others
 to pick up the slack, especially during holidays, and it’s not a “give 
and take” if the giving is always one-sided. I’ve never once even heard 
of a parent volunteering to work more for someone without kids because 
usually parents assume that their time off is more valuable than 
childfree people’s.
I’d also like to add that the office and any workspace is not 
supposed to be your child’s support system. You should be civil and kind
 with coworkers and maybe friendship even forms but your coworkers 
should never be exploited as a support system for a child that none of 
them chose to have. It’s an unfair expectation. Also, it’s 
unprofessional to view childfree coworkers’ time off and holidays as 
less important just because they aren’t parents. Their families want 
them home for the holidays too and they also have loved ones who want to
 spend weekends with them.
Yeah i don't know the specifics of your scenario, if there's 
different shifts and people are avoidnundesirabke shifts or pulling 
stuff at the last minute.
I've only ever done 9 to 5 type jobs so I did personally believe 
that the parents deserved special treatment because I thought it would 
make two people far happier than it would make me who didn't really have
 an impact from taking leave in November instead of December.
My main thing would be that there should be no expectation, no 
entitlement. Parents should ask not demand things of their child free 
colleagues, be grateful for the accommodation that is provided and 
understanding when it can't be.
I’m a college student but I also work at an animal hospital. I 
personally think that parents don’t deserve any special treatment at all
 because the choice to have kids is an entirely neutral life decision. I
 don’t think it warrants special treatment or makes someone more 
important nor their time more important.
I was inspired to write this post by a specific coworker of mine 
who constantly asks myself and other Gen Z coworkers to cover her and 
work holidays and weekends because she thinks it’s more important for 
her to have that time off than it is for us because we don’t have kids. I
 obviously disagree with her and try to explain to her that we all have 
families that want us home for the holidays and weekends, whether those 
families include kids or not doesn’t matter.
I also want to say that I think it’s awesome that you don’t 
believe that there should ever be expectations that non-parents cover 
for parents and work holidays and weekends for them. I find that it’s 
all too common that people expect that and it creates such a toxic work 
culture.
Entitlement is one of my biggest pet peeves, so if it's happening all the time, I get it.

[Zawaya]: Preach. I work in a mandatory overtime place. I don't even give 
excuses anymore. I'll listen to the sob story about getting home to 
their kids and offer nothing but a nope, can't stay. I have a life too. 
Don't drag me into yours for a guilt trip.
[RavenclawGirl2005]: Agreed. Just because it takes a village to raise a child doesn't 
mean that I have to or want to be a part of your fucking village.
THIS! And it’s so strange that they’d even want people in their “village” that don’t want to be part of it.
I know right. I'm the oldest of four children, but my parents 
never tried to force people to be a part of their "village" if they 
didn't want to. I find it to be confusing how a person could trust 
someone with their child if they were forcing them to be a part of their
 "village" when they didn't want to be.

[itchylol742]: tell them to pound sand lmao. take a lesson from billionaires: be ruthless
[TheHoss_]: Don’t cover for coworkers in general cuz they never do it back, no matter how many times you’ve covered for them

[atsinged]: If Reddit existed for Gen X when we were in your age group, this would be a top post.
It's top competition, at least as far as work environment 
complaints, would be all the extra 5-10 minute breaks smokers took.
[Wxskater]: I volunteer for holidays bc i dont have kids or family where i 
live and i want the holiday pay. We try to help each other in the office
 and trade and make deals with each other. Like yeah ill do this swap 
with you if you swap with me for something else. You scratch my back ill
 scratch yours kinda thing.
[Money_Context9315]: Just take out the kids and it won’t be a problem anymore.
(For legal reasons I’m just kidding, therefore I am not responsible if any kids are murdered or go missing)
[TrashApocalypse]: You k ow how they say it takes a village? This is the part where 
you’re the village. But you for sure shouldn’t be the only villager 
helping out. Be mad at the bosses and managers for not hiring more 
people, not the people trying to procreate and keep the species alive.
“The village” should be people who are willing participants and 
actually want to be involved. “The village” should NOT be unwilling 
coworkers that did not choose to have the child and don’t want any part 
in raising a child. “The village” also should NOT be anyone who doesn’t 
want to be part of it. It’s incredibly entitled and selfish to believe 
that you are entitled to other people’s time just because you have a 
child. Also, we are way too evolved of a species to be “procreating to 
keep the species alive”. We are a civilized people that need to be 
financially, psychologically, and generally prepared before making the 
choice to have a child. Just reproducing for the sake of reproduction 
would be an extremely irresponsible and foolish decision to make.
I mean, I totally understand hating people and not wanting to help
 anyone but yourself. Our society is structured this way. You feel 
entitled to not have to help anyone, while also not realizing how many 
people around you are helping you. I wish you luck in your endeavor to 
remove yourself from the village, and I already feel sorry for you for 
the moment you realize you succeeded.
Not falling for this. All they do is take and take. You cover for 
them on a few occasions, then it gets to the point where they start to 
feel entitled to your time. And if you decide not to help, you suddenly 
are the selfish one. It's classic manipulation. This "village" only 
benefits one person.
You are 100% right. I’m so tired of the assumptions that we don’t 
have families that want us home for holidays and weekends just because 
those families don’t include kids. We have families, friends, and things
 to do with our time. We deserve our weekends and holidays just as much 
as they do. We deserve our time off just as much as they do. Our time is
 just as valuable.
You, one single person, does not make a village. In your scenario 
you are certainly being used. A village is made of a lot of people who 
help and support each other. Your scenario sounds like a boss or manager
 is taking advantage of you cause they don’t want to hire another 
person.
You’re projecting a lot. Wanting clear boundaries isn’t the same 
as “hating people” or “not wanting to help anyone but myself.” It’s 
about rejecting the assumption that we owe labor, time, or emotional 
bandwidth simply because someone else chose to have a child.
No one should be forced to be part of anyone’s “village,” and it’s
 not entitlement to say you don’t want to be. It’s also very strange to 
me that you’d even want people in your “village” that don’t want to be. 
If community means forced obligation, then it’s not community, it’s 
exploitation. Of course I appreciate the invisible labor that goes into 
society, but there’s a big difference between general mutual support and
 being expected to pick up extra work or shifts because someone else has
 kids.
The truth is, no one’s stopping parents from building their own 
villages with people who voluntarily want to be part of them. But 
pressuring unwilling people, especially younger ones with fewer 
resources and no kids of their own, is not noble. It’s shifting personal
 responsibilities onto others without their consent. That’s not “the 
village.” That’s a boundary issue.
You’re just making your village, and your community smaller. And 
again, ignoring the consequences of what will happen when you’ve 
rejected people from your community/village, because you dont feel like 
you “owe anyone” as if all relationships are transactions.
Who will be there for anyone with an attitude like this? If you 
don’t feel like you should make small sacrifices for other people, why 
would anyone do it for you? What happens when you need help? Everyone 
can just reject you from their village and you can just suffer alone, 
which, is kind of what’s happening all around the country.
Some people don’t have support, they don’t have a village through 
their family or friends, and they rely on strangers for support. And 
you’re just letting everyone know you aren’t that stranger. I’m not 
saying you should be the only one helping, but this attitude is why so 
MANY people aren’t stepping up to help their communities and the entire 
country is suffering due to this, yes, wave of selfishness.
You’re framing boundaries as rejection and mutual aid as obligation, and those are not the same thing.
I’m not saying we should all live in isolation or never help each 
other. I’m saying help should be freely given, not coerced, especially 
in professional environments where power dynamics and burnout exist. A 
“village” built on guilt, expectation, or moral superiority isn’t a 
healthy or sustainable one and frankly I don’t know why you’d want that.
If someone doesn’t want to pick up a coworker’s slack because of 
their childcare issues, that’s not heartlessness, it’s having 
boundaries. Wanting autonomy over our time and labor isn’t selfish. It’s
 realistic. And frankly, it’s necessary for a generation that’s already 
stretched thin financially, emotionally, and socially. Mutual support 
thrives when everyone consents to it, not when people are shamed into 
service. If we really want stronger communities, the solution isn’t to 
pressure others into helping.
Also, not everyone likes children. Not everyone wants to help 
raise a child and that’s valid. We are a generation that is increasingly
 known for choosing to be childfree in greater numbers for several 
different reasons so it’s strange to me that on a sub about Gen Z that 
you’d talk about forcing people to raise or help raise others’ kids. 
Liking or tolerating kids isn’t some universal moral obligation. For 
some people, it’s emotionally draining, overstimulating, or just not 
something they ever signed up for. Expecting people to help raise or 
carry the burden of raising your kids, especially without consent, isn’t
 community, it’s entitlement.
As to your last paragraph, I never said that.
Yes, “a generation that’s already stretched thin, financially, 
emotionally and socially” and you think the solution is to reject 
community support? Why do you think you’re stretched so thin? Because of
 this type of attitude. You can call it whatever you want but this 
attitude destroys a community before it could ever even begin. If you 
don’t show up for people until they show up for you, and everyone has 
this attitude, no one is showing up for anyone.
Again, if you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at the bosses and 
managers for not hiring enough people to stretch the workload to help 
people with kids.
How is it support if it’s completely one-sided? Parents never take
 extra days or work hours for those without children. This entire post 
is about the sense of entitlement that parents have solely because they 
have kids. You’re calling it “community support,” but real community is 
mutual, not people without kids constantly picking up the slack for 
those who chose to have them. If only one side is expected to “show up,”
 that’s not community. That’s exploitation dressed up as virtue. No one 
is saying we shouldn’t support each other, just that parenthood is a 
personal decision, and others shouldn’t be guilted into bearing the 
emotional or workload consequences of it. Especially in a workforce 
that’s already stretched thin, consent matters.
Good luck when it’s you.
I’m not having kids so that won’t be an issue

You, one single person, does not make a village. In your scenario 
you are certainly being used. A village is made of a lot of people who 
help and support each other. Your scenario sounds like a boss or manager
 is taking advantage of you cause they don’t want to hire another 
person.
You’re projecting a lot. Wanting clear boundaries isn’t the same 
as “hating people” or “not wanting to help anyone but myself.” It’s 
about rejecting the assumption that we owe labor, time, or emotional 
bandwidth simply because someone else chose to have a child.
No one should be forced to be part of anyone’s “village,” and it’s
 not entitlement to say you don’t want to be. It’s also very strange to 
me that you’d even want people in your “village” that don’t want to be. 
If community means forced obligation, then it’s not community, it’s 
exploitation. Of course I appreciate the invisible labor that goes into 
society, but there’s a big difference between general mutual support and
 being expected to pick up extra work or shifts because someone else has
 kids.
The truth is, no one’s stopping parents from building their own 
villages with people who voluntarily want to be part of them. But 
pressuring unwilling people, especially younger ones with fewer 
resources and no kids of their own, is not noble. It’s shifting personal
 responsibilities onto others without their consent. That’s not “the 
village.” That’s a boundary issue.
You’re just making your village, and your community smaller. And 
again, ignoring the consequences of what will happen when you’ve 
rejected people from your community/village, because you dont feel like 
you “owe anyone” as if all relationships are transactions.
Who will be there for anyone with an attitude like this? If you 
don’t feel like you should make small sacrifices for other people, why 
would anyone do it for you? What happens when you need help? Everyone 
can just reject you from their village and you can just suffer alone, 
which, is kind of what’s happening all around the country.
Some people don’t have support, they don’t have a village through 
their family or friends, and they rely on strangers for support. And 
you’re just letting everyone know you aren’t that stranger. I’m not 
saying you should be the only one helping, but this attitude is why so 
MANY people aren’t stepping up to help their communities and the entire 
country is suffering due to this, yes, wave of selfishness.
You’re framing boundaries as rejection and mutual aid as obligation, and those are not the same thing.
I’m not saying we should all live in isolation or never help each 
other. I’m saying help should be freely given, not coerced, especially 
in professional environments where power dynamics and burnout exist. A 
“village” built on guilt, expectation, or moral superiority isn’t a 
healthy or sustainable one and frankly I don’t know why you’d want that.
If someone doesn’t want to pick up a coworker’s slack because of 
their childcare issues, that’s not heartlessness, it’s having 
boundaries. Wanting autonomy over our time and labor isn’t selfish. It’s
 realistic. And frankly, it’s necessary for a generation that’s already 
stretched thin financially, emotionally, and socially. Mutual support 
thrives when everyone consents to it, not when people are shamed into 
service. If we really want stronger communities, the solution isn’t to 
pressure others into helping.
Also, not everyone likes children. Not everyone wants to help 
raise a child and that’s valid. We are a generation that is increasingly
 known for choosing to be childfree in greater numbers for several 
different reasons so it’s strange to me that on a sub about Gen Z that 
you’d talk about forcing people to raise or help raise others’ kids. 
Liking or tolerating kids isn’t some universal moral obligation. For 
some people, it’s emotionally draining, overstimulating, or just not 
something they ever signed up for. Expecting people to help raise or 
carry the burden of raising your kids, especially without consent, isn’t
 community, it’s entitlement.
As to your last paragraph, I never said that.
Yes, “a generation that’s already stretched thin, financially, 
emotionally and socially” and you think the solution is to reject 
community support? Why do you think you’re stretched so thin? Because of
 this type of attitude. You can call it whatever you want but this 
attitude destroys a community before it could ever even begin. If you 
don’t show up for people until they show up for you, and everyone has 
this attitude, no one is showing up for anyone.
Again, if you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at the bosses and 
managers for not hiring enough people to stretch the workload to help 
people with kids.
How is it support if it’s completely one-sided? Parents never take
 extra days or work hours for those without children. This entire post 
is about the sense of entitlement that parents have solely because they 
have kids. You’re calling it “community support,” but real community is 
mutual, not people without kids constantly picking up the slack for 
those who chose to have them. If only one side is expected to “show up,”
 that’s not community. That’s exploitation dressed up as virtue. No one 
is saying we shouldn’t support each other, just that parenthood is a 
personal decision, and others shouldn’t be guilted into bearing the 
emotional or workload consequences of it. Especially in a workforce 
that’s already stretched thin, consent matters.
Good luck when it’s you.
I’m not having kids so that won’t be an issue
[TrashApocalypse]: I mean, I totally understand hating people and not wanting to help
 anyone but yourself. Our society is structured this way. You feel 
entitled to not have to help anyone, while also not realizing how many 
people around you are helping you. I wish you luck in your endeavor to 
remove yourself from the village, and I already feel sorry for you for 
the moment you realize you succeeded.
Not falling for this. All they do is take and take. You cover for 
them on a few occasions, then it gets to the point where they start to 
feel entitled to your time. And if you decide not to help, you suddenly 
are the selfish one. It's classic manipulation. This "village" only 
benefits one person.
You are 100% right. I’m so tired of the assumptions that we don’t 
have families that want us home for holidays and weekends just because 
those families don’t include kids. We have families, friends, and things
 to do with our time. We deserve our weekends and holidays just as much 
as they do. We deserve our time off just as much as they do. Our time is
 just as valuable.

--- DOCUMENTO: The Brainrot agenda is peak Dunning-Kruger effect _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: The Brainrot agenda is peak Dunning-Kruger effect : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
"The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people 
with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their 
abilities." - Wikipedia
This new trend of slapping the label of "brainrot" on literally 
ANYTHING is pure Dunning-Kruger effect in action. An inability and 
unwillingness to source and comprehend the meaning behind any media or 
cultural phenomenon has resulted in the trend of scapegoating whichever 
media one might disagree with or not understand by simply forcing a 
label which does not fit by definition onto it.
One of the biggest examples of the Dunning-Kruger effect I see at 
play in this agenda is the ludicrous claim that "MLG is brainrot". I 
suppose I'll be the one to explain, since those making this claim refuse
 to understand, that the viral MLG edits back in the 2010s were satire, 
and poking fun at the irony of Faze kids and the competitive nature of 
actual MLG tournaments, along with the insane and over the top editing 
style of clips taken from these tournaments. It wasn't and isn't as 
serious as people are taking it now, and that's the point those claiming
 it's brainrot seem to be missing.
However, the nature of the 2010s' self deprecating humor did 
result in many using MLG as a slang to describe wins, outfits(swag), EDM
 or dubstep music, and raves. Me and my friends used the term aplenty 
while playing rounds of CoD at each other's houses, or during/after 
parties and concerts. This evolved the term from not just being ironic 
slang for gaming moments and competition, but also slang for cool or 
based things which typically facilitated unadulterated fun with people 
and friends.
There was a clear line between what's serious and what's not, and 
the culture heavily played on this line as reflected in the humor of the
 time. Filthy Frank definitely helped to influence cleverly utilizing 
this line without blurring it to prove points, more specifically about 
social media and everything people should not be. Unfortunately as of 
now however, somewhere the line between serious and not was blurred out 
of existence. And rather than people attempting to educate themselves on
 where the line was or should be, they've opted to shun the 
responsibility of having to understand any media they refer to as 
brainrot, choosing to instead point the finger outwards at media and not
 their lack of understanding for why people are apparently 
"brainrotted". This is further perputated by internet echochambers 
facilitated by chronically online individuals, since multiple people 
under the Dunning-Kruger effect agreeing on the same falsity creates 
this convincing illusion that their opinion must be right since the 
amount of people online believing it as the absolute truth outnumbers 
the facts they refuse to learn and accept. This becomes insanely blatant
 in comparison to the real world, as everyone I've asked (Friends, and 
their friends, coworkers, classmates, etc.) aliken those pushing the 
brainrot agenda to a collective of hypocritical old folk yelling at 
clouds from the comfort of their basements. Practically no one outside 
the internet thinks things like memes, or MLG qualify as brainrot.
This is the one defining generational cycle, akin to when those in
 the '90s would refer to party people as "burnouts", where a group 
suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect blame cultured people enjoying 
themselves for being brainrotted or burnt out due to what they consume. 
When these people being labeled as brainrotted or burn outs were in 
previous decades the ones directly helping movements like civil rights 
or womens rights, and responsible for moving our society forward under 
what's right. When in reality, it's those under the Dunning-Kruger 
effect suffering from their limited competence that have a brain issue. 
Due to this agenda/phenomenon, I don't expect those under the effect to 
fully grasp this post, atleast upon the first read. So do what you will 
with this informative observation, hopefully it'll open your mind just a
 little, and you'll do your part to stop the only generational conundrum
 at play here. Perhaps most of this is likely part of a bigger 
problem(s) in society, but either way, I've stated some of the facts 
here for those ready and able to take them in for what they are.

TÍTULO: The most burnt out generation : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Hi, I don’t typically post on here but I just felt the need to 
given all of stuff that’s happening socially, economically, and 
environmentally around us, at least in the US. I was born in the year 
2000. I had the typical upbringing with parents and grandparents pushing
 high education in the pursuit of a good job and a happy life. That’s 
what my parents had. Their college education brought them their jobs and
 in turn, their house and their kids. This is a tired conversation, but I
 came here to vent because I’m sick of this frankly, fucking awful 
situation we were born into. Gen Z went through 2 recessions, a pandemic
 and currently going through a housing crisis. The cost of college is 
astronomical, and student debt consumes the lives of the sorry people 
who went through college. At this point college is only good for the 
hyper-wealthy, who can afford to send their kids through college without
 putting them through debt. High paying jobs are now inaccessible to 
most people.
Those of us that are working don’t make enough to buy a house 
because we are paying off student debt, or because housing is the most 
unaffordable it has ever been.
It fucking sucks. We aren’t lying when we say the American dream 
is dead. On top of that, all the other generations hate us and blame us 
for our shortcomings. Then we have the looming climate crisis and the 
fucking threat of nuclear war. Is it any wonder why we are all hopeless?
I’m curious to hear how you guys are navigating life and working through these issues because I’m just so tired.

[pc-21-37]: I always find it so funny how many people blame and hate our 
generation, like bro I’m 21 what exactly did I do to you or this economy
 and planet that’s so bad lol y’all just pointing figures and finding 
scapegoats at this point. I’ve worked shit paying jobs and graduated 
High School like 3 years ago after having my education ruined my the 
school system of the US in todays world and a worldwide pandemic but 
yeah you are right I’m the problem, I did this. The world is completely 
ruined and it’s all my fault, thanks for the constant reminders instead 
of looking at your part and doing something bout it lol.
This is how I’ve always felt about Boomers who bitch about kids these days getting “participation trophies.”
THEY ARE THE ADULTS WHO STARTED GIVING OUT THE TROPHIES. 😭
Only being able to get a job at $13 an hour at 15 hours a week is a
 real good participation trophy my friend! It’s like there handing us 
gold and it makes them so jealous 😢😭
They are also the adults who dont understand you cant buy stuff 
with only a dollar anymore, like my boomer grand parents give me 5 
dollers for birthdays and shit while my Great Grandparents are giving me
 actual financial help with school and enough money to start my life. 
Like gramps thats a gallon of gas...

[Feeling-Currency6212]: Yeah, the millennials and Gen Z are at a huge disadvantage 
compared to older generations. As you said, most of us are surviving 
instead of thriving. The value of money when they were our age was 
significantly higher than the value of money is today.
We also have to worry about AI innovation, mass illegal 
immigration, and outsourcing to Asia. We have been stripped of the 
opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Gen Z also has the unique 
challenge of rising interest rates which makes loans a life-long debt.
We don't have to worry about mass illegal immigration.  The fact 
that lettuce isn't 8 dollars a head is thanks to illegal immigrants. The
 illegal immigration "crisis' is just a polite way of pushing racism and
 xenophobia into the narrative.
If it makes you feel better the mass illegal immigration thing is 
very overblown and generally speaking they’re not taking the kind of 
jobs that you or anyone else here would most likely want
Millennial here. I was in high school when the dot com bubble 
burst and 9/11 happened. Much civil unrest and protest during the G.W. 
Bush years. Graduated college right as the Great Recession was 
happening. Job hunting issues. Student Loan crisis when that first 
became a big deal. Then Covid. Now inflation, all the issues you 
mentioned, who is about to take office again, etc. We've literally NEVER
 had any great extended time periods in our adult lives. Had constant 
issues with my Dad over money and homeownership. I keep hearing stories 
of people who can't even afford to buy the same house that their 
great-grandfather built by hand who didn't attend school after the 8th 
grade. I'm not even sure how to be optimistic anymore. Feels like so 
much hard work and determination went to nothing.
Illegal immigration is a problem when it comes to thing like crime
 and homelessness, not the job market. They're taking under the table, 
generally high danger and illegal jobs from anyone who will give.
I doubt the average American citizrn is missing out much by being 
paid $2 at a factory working 10 hour shifts under the table.
So at the very least, Gen Z (and the average American, really) 
don't really have to worry about that as a roadblock to our economic 
success.
What you might have to keep in mind there is that if they don’t 
have the option to pay illegal immigrants under the table, then they 
should ideally be paying Americans minimum wage, which at least opens up
 more minimum wage job.
... Yeah. Obviously. Conversely, what you might have to keep in 
mind is that an employer who hires under the table associates is not 
going to be paying American citizen workers minimum wage if they can 
keep getting away with what they're doing and not get caught.
Unless action is taken by a governing body, then they're obviously
 not gonna conduct their business legally, just because they "should 
ideally" be doing that.
Stopping illegal immigrants from being here isn't going to stop 
those companies from doing shady employing. There's millions of illegal 
immigrants from all over the world in this country, do you think 
stopping the spigot now would stop those shady companies from filling up
 their buckets?
Very naïve thoughtline.
The value of money part is huge. Never mind even the cost of 
housing and food, I’m in university right now, and if I want to go to 
the bar to drink with friends, 6-8 beers is probably going to run me 
$60. Back when my dad was in school in the 80s, bars had 1$ beer nights.
 Literally everything fun costs an obscene amount of money now. Even if 
you can afford housing and food, it’s still ridiculously expensive to do
 anything.
Well, yeah because $1 in 1980 is equal to $3.83 in 2024. That 
means the dollar today has like a quarter of the value that the 1980 
dollar had.
Climate change is a much more pressing issue than any of those things you said in the second paragraph 😭
That is a global issue and there are countries that won’t cooperate like China and India

[Hot-Inflation4689]: As a milennial looking in, it seemed before the pandemic that your
 lives wouldve been great, now with everything happening, i feel like 
you guys took a far worse beating than we did, when people say 'gen z 
look old' i can see why, the stress toll is massive, hoping you guys 
pull through
[[deleted]]: Gen Z is certainly facing a lot of problems and you could argue 
the last few generations have had it better than us but I'd say we're 
still luckier than most generations that have come before us and are 
actually pretty privileged by historic standards.
The lost generation for example (born 1883-1900) faced 2 world 
wars, the great depression, much lower living standards and a much 
shorter life expectancy than we have today. The air in the cities and 
towns was heavily polluted, London especially was notorious for its 
pea-soupers etc.
I'm 21 now, people of this generation had often had to contend 
with a couple of years in the trenches by the time they were my age, 
with the Blitz and rationing to look forward to in their 40s-60s.
Prior to that there were generations where for most jobs typically
 involved long hours and were physically demanding for very little pay, 
slums were much more common in the western world. Medicine wasn't 
anywhere near as advanced as it is today etc.
You’re right, and don’t get me wrong I am very grateful for the privileges we do have compared to those generations.
But there are wars going on and the world hasn’t felt at peace, to
 me, EVER. I was born, then fucking 9/11 happened pretty much right 
after. Then we went to war with Afghanistan for 20 fucking years, almost
 my whole life. Our country has spent so much money on that war and now 
the newer war in Ukraine. We have had no say in this. I guess that’s 
just how it is but it really fucking sucks. Complaining doesn’t 
accomplish much I know, but when we’re powerless to the decisions our 
government is making it’s all I feel that I can do.

But wars have been going on for centuries though. I'm hard pressed
 to even find a time where there wasn't any wars going on or the looming
 threat of war.
In the second half of the 20th Century, among others, there was 
the Korean war, Vietnam war, Falklands war, gulf war, Afghanistan war, 
the US invasion of Grenada, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia 
among many others with the Cold War, several communist revolutions, the 
Cuban Missile Crisis, collapse of the Eastern Block, the threat of 
nuclear war and several civil wars around the world thrown in for good 
measures.
Prior to that there was 2 world wars, the Spanish Civil War, the 
rise and fall of several fascist regimes, the Balkan crisis, Moroccan 
crises, the Russian revolution, the overthrow of several of Europe's 
monarchies.
The 19th Century saw the American Civil War, Napoleonic Wars, the 
Punjab War, the War of 1812, the Texas- Indian Wars, the Boer Wars, the 
Crimean War, among goodness knows how many others, plus the abolition of
 slavery in the UK and US thrown in for good measures.
The list goes on.
Our country has spent so much money on that war and now the newer 
war in Ukraine. We have had no say in this. I guess that’s just how it 
is but it really fucking sucks.
Possibly I'm still haunted by the 1930s but if we, as the western world don't fight these wars what's the alternative?
The alternative would be to allow the likes of Putin to gobble up 
more and more territory. I doubt Putin shall stop at Ukraine, that sort 
of ruler seldom do as history has shown. If Ukraine falls he shall be 
emboldened to go after some of his other neighbours. If however we give 
Ukraine the resources it needs to throw Russian troops out of Ukraine 
and the war is seen to be a disaster for Putin he'll think twice about 
pursuing an aggressive foreign policy, which could easily prevent war in
 the long run.
Democracy is worth defending IMHO.

 out of office. Even if you go for a smaller party that never wins this

[Junior_Response839]: High key I'm tired of being part of "the promised generation". I occasionally see posts of people (mostly inr/millenials) saying
 "what happened to gen z? Why are they redpilled? They're supposed to be
 the generation to fix everything and usher in change!" And seeing them 
costs me way more mental energy than it should, admittedly.
I didn't ask to be born in the generation that's supposed to fix 
climate change, fix our country's problems, other country's problems, 
society's problems,on topof fixing our own unique personal problems.
Bro I'm just trying to make money, be a good person, and thrive 
pursuing my own hobbies and passions. In my opinion it's fine to be a 
bit selfish sometimes and focus on ourselves and the people close to us,
 not the whole damn world. You can't pour from an empty cup.
True but this is the same energy that lead to the older generations handing your generation a dimmer world.

things a little better.

been just a bit worse than not being able to move out of mom’s basement.
 I guess it depends on your perspective.

[stoRedditor]: Thank you for hearing me out as well
[Anon-Sham]: Burnt out probably isn't the best term for it. If you're burnt out
 at 24, it's probably that you lacked resilience in the first place.
Every generation has entered the workforce in a worse condition than the previous since the baby boomers.
But at 24, you haven't really felt it yet.
The last financial crisis occurred when you were a little kid, the pandemic happened when you were college aged.
And yeah the housing market sucks, but if you've only been out of 
college for say 3 years, it's still pretty early for you. Even for Gen x
 peeps it wasn't uncommon to rent well into the late 20s or early 30s.
If you think the recessions you've experienced were bad, think of 
how much harder it is for people who were adults at the time with kids 
dependent on them.
Oh yeah absolutely they were hard for people with children, no 
doubt. But at least, in my parents case, they already had a house, had 
college degrees and job security when the 2008 recession happened. 
That’s not to say they didn’t struggle, but at least they already built 
up their lives and weren’t experiencing things like $2400 rent for a 
one-bedroom and insanely high prices on houses.
During the 2020 recession I was a broke college student and it 
made my outlook on the future look really dim. The pandemic robbed me of
 the optimism someone my age should have.
Also, just because I’m young doesn’t mean I can’t/shouldn’t feel burnt out.
Burn out is usually a long term thing. If you're feeling Burn out 
in your first couple of years in the work place I'd be concerned there 
is something else at play. I've got a psych background but I don't like 
playing armchair psychologist but I'd be concerned there may be some 
underlying depression or anxiety at play.
It's definitely a messed up situation, I live in Australia and 
housing costs are even worse here because the baby boomers made housing a
 commodity instead of a basic need to living. Here your options to get 
housing are to have an extremely high paying job, have an inheritance, 
or live 100+ km away from the city.

[Helpful_Ground460]: Housing isn't very interesting, I'd rather have cool mega projects
 than boring old housing, if everyone's homeless they have nothing to 
lose anyway
[AWholeBunchOfMumms]: Girl try focusing on some positives. Do you go to sleep with a 
roof over your head? Are you secure knowing when you’ll be able to eat 
your next meal?
Not saying you can’t be sad/tired just because others have it worse, but perspective is important.
[Alejandroses]: As a millennial we KNOW this.
"It fucking sucks. We aren’t lying when we say the American dream is dead."
It is dead and one person is trying to revive it and they hate him for it.
Want to know how to make your life better? Buy crypto. You are 
like the last generation that will exist with crypto being this low. It 
will never happen again once it takes over the world.
There is one person who is also embracing crypto but they hate him. Well, meainstream hates him, real americans love him.
I doubt Trump knows anything about crypto beyond that “it’s good 
and Elon likes it”. Placing your faith in one politician to solve all 
your problems never ends well
I rather have a president who embraces it than one who does not 
lol. Hes not going to solve all our issues but he sure as fuck cant make
 them worse than 2020 - 2024 lol
I mean all things considered we are doing pretty good compared to 
the rest of the world, wage gap is shrinking, inflation is down 
massively from COVID times, unemployment is low. Costs are higher yes 
but that’s just a natural consequence of a global pandemic, we could be

2017-2019, I was a psych ward burnout loser with -$0.97 in my bank

[[deleted]]: I have it much better. April 2020 I bought a shit hole  house that
 I hate to this day and got laid off the next day. Well the lockdown was
 a hard reset for me because I had to go back to doing shit work until 
2021 then I got a good job, in 2023 sold that shit house and bought my 
childhood house still working at the same place I was in 21 and have 
gotten a lot better mental health. Physical health is still a little 
weird sometimes.
[[deleted]]: Life has gotten much better than pre2020 for everyone lol
[Technical_College240]: I moved over 2k miles from my hometown, went to college, 
completely cut ties with my family, finished my education and training, 
got a good job, and been in a serious relationship for several years
[Bladeofwar94]: I have it better more because I work a tipped position and a lot of people quit into 2021.
The money is slowing down now actually, but I could certainly be a lot worse off.
Covid was a good reset to the business I work at since they were panicking to keep guys like me on board.
[GreatGameMate]: I definitely have it better. Pre covid I was entering my freshman 
year. Covid happened my spring semester, march 13th. Didn’t go back to 
school till next year. It was a breeze to be honest, I didnt have to 
worry about much because I lived with my parents.
Currently a sophomore in college, living by myself, got a car, got
 a job, got a furry friend. Always trying to do better and pass off the 
positivity to the ones around me.
[iloveuncleklaus]: Personal responsibility. No one's gonna make your life better but you homie.

I'm with my coworker who is close to retiring in his 50s. We are 
the same rank and similar pay level. He bought a house in his 20s with a
 job where he was making less. He keeps asking why I wanted to get 
promotions so fast and I told him I want to be able to afford a house by
 35. It seems the only way to realistically do so in a timely manner is 
to aggressively promote whereas in the past it was something anyone 
could do if they could save a bit over a few years.
I worry for future generations, if they will lose out on goals that are reaches for us.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[rogun64]: As an Xer, I think that's a good analysis. Another thing is that 
because we were a smaller generation, economic growth shrunk and few new
 jobs were added, so we had to wait for Boomers to retire. As you 
probably know, Boomers waited a long time to retire and so we moved up 
very slowly.
Yes that’s so true!!! so many of my coworkers are boomers who 
still refuse to retire. They have pensions and are financially able to 
do so. Our company begs them to retire every time layoffs come to save a
 younger persons job and they still refuse its wild.
My theory is the boomers hate their home life so they just want to
 stay at work to feel they’re important and have a social life
It's multifaceted. But as flawed as their generation is they are 
absolute prisoners to the extremely high expectations of conformity, 
appearances, approval of others, materialism, capital interests, and the
 same seriously troubled world the rest of us have to deal with.
They sold out for material luxuries, low stress lifestyles and the
 promise of a gilded retirement if only they sacrifice themselves of the
 alter of capitalism. I think a lot of them, now that they've reached 
retirement age, have no concept of themselves beyond a manager or a 
professional or a hot shot who makes the big bucks and buys whatever 
they want.
But those lifestyles are often fundamentally empty. Their focus on
 acquiring money (never enough) working long hours in jobs they dislike 
has left their marriages coasting, or toxic, or broken. It seems that 
the majority have tense or estranged relationships with their children 
and hardly any are close with their grandchildren. It's all smoke and 
mirrors and empty promises that were never fulfilled. For a lot of 
boomers, retirement will be waiting for death in a big house, separate 
bedrooms or even floors away from their spouse most of the time, passing
 the time watching TV. I truly don't think the majority are remotely 
self-actualized individuals. The whole thing was a big fucking lie.

100% agree with everything you said!
A lot of them seem to hate their spouses too. The “I hate my wife 
she’s such a bitch” mean “jokes” seem to come 100% from boomers.
Just bc you hate your home life and never wanna be home, doesn’t mean the rest of us feel the same way!
Very well put. And yet I still see younger people, mostly 
millennials, aspire to the same false hopes. But since it’s much harder 
now it’s usually accompanied by help from boomer parents.
BRUH - I worked at a call center for retirement record keeping and
 for real, some boomers just don’t want to retire despite having plenty 
in their retirement. I see their salaries and what their workers make 
and they try to skimp out on matches at the bare minimum to pass the 
required compliance testing.

It must be the default flair, because I never set it and I was born 40 years earlier than that.

[[deleted]]: Sad reality: most people will. The moment you touch assisted living or a nursing home.
I implore yall: get in touch with a lawyer and move your assets 
into trusts. Specifically to protect them from Medicaid. The government 
looks back five years from when you make the claim, and they WILL claw 
it all back. Including if you “gift” anything to family. There’s people 
in my family whose mom had Alzheimer’s and had to go to an assisted 
living facility. Six figure cost per month. All retirement and pension 
gone. All equity in house gone. All personal property sold. To pay it.
Because they didn’t move assets 5 years earlier than they thought they needed to.
Medicare covers jack shit for stuff like that. Medicaid picks up 
the rest. But you have to be abjectly and utterly poor. Nothing to your 
name.
And many facilities know this. So if you’ve anything to your name 
they will require you to”buy” your way into a Medicaid bed by first 
paying private rates for a couple years first to “reserve” the Medicaid 
placement.
So for the love of god, get an estate planning attorney and move 
your shit to where nobody can touch it unprotected. I’ve seen too many 
nest eggs for the next gen get gobbled up by the government.
[davezerep]: Blaming an entire generation—or two generations—is the type of 
scapegoating that is used to divide people so that the wealthy can 
continue to pillage the world. Race, religion, nation, generation, those
 aren’t the sides. The haves and have nots are the sides.
This is the reality of the situation. Nepotism and corruption transcends generations and even race.
I am exposed to Boomers and older Gen X folks and the inverse 
narrative is just as toxic and destructive. “These 20 year olds are 
making millions on Tik Tok” … “I never had the opportunities these kids 
had”.
But let’s call it what it really is. Attractive, charismatic, 
dominant individuals have a natural advantage toward wealth and power.

the laziness they love. Leave us out of your shit, we’re busy working 
and doing stuff while you complain, but we have all the same problems.
[ScorpionDog321]: Fast forward and GenZ will do whatever to the economy and 3 generations from now they will be blaming you.
[losemgmt]: Don’t lump Gen X in there. FFS why are people now suddenly remembering we exist and bashing us.
[kateinoly]: Blaming others who were just doing what they could is a bad look. 
 Do you seriously think your forebears were thinking, "I'm gonna screw 
over my grandkids?"
[[deleted]]: Gen X here. Trust me, we worked our asses off through a bad 
recession around ‘02. The dot-com bust, 9/11, the tumbling market, etc. 
Unemployment was around 6%. My parents worked hard and scrimped too, but
 the economy was more fruitful for them than me.
It was a really bad time for us getting out of college and not 
even being hired in fast food. We all believed that a college degree 
would land you a good job like the Boomers told us.  A lot of us were 
destitute, working minimum wage jobs while paying back high interest 
student loans for 30 years. Parents didn’t help because they thought we 
were being lazy because that’s not how the market was for them after 
college.
[[deleted]]: Really? Where do you come up with this nonsense that Gen X 
destroyed the economy for you? The issues you raise have more to do with
 the struggle between the rich and working classes.
[Chance_State8385]: Explain... Back up your theory...or rather naive thought process.
[SubjectThrowaway11]: No not really, it's the elite who actually had the power to change
 how things progressed. You've just been told it's your parents and 
grandparents who screwed things up but if we were in their shoes we

[TheFox1331]: 100% generation has no impact on how hard someone works in my 
opinion. I’m mid 20’s and I work on a med/surg floor and some of the 
older nurses are great, some suck. Just like how some of the younger 
nurses are great and some of the younger ones suck
[uRtrds]: That’s the main mentality of Reddit.
[Dramajunker]: I was reading some of the replies from the locked thread about 
approaching women. It's fucking sad how many young men have convinced 
themselves that the worst thing possible can happen if they ask a woman 
out. Im convinced that the younger generation just spends too much time 
online doom scrolling.
[ZanaHoroa]: Same, I wouldn't be surprised if I worked 4x less hard than my 
grandparents. They grew up barely having enough to eat and I'm sitting 
at home typing on a computer making more than they could've dreamed of 
making.
[Ayacyte]: Yeah maybe houses were more affordable or whatever back then but 
that doesn't really mean work was easier. I don't think I work 4x harder
 than my parents or grandparents did at my age. The men were in the 
military anyways... It's not a good comparison. Less genz are wanting to
 go into military even though it can be a good option to pay off 
college.
[Necessary_Good_4827]: Especially as a black gen z person....
Or a Catholic gen z person here in Northern Ireland…
Nah that ain't even work that's fighting for your life lmao

[[deleted]]: Yeah like, how far back are we talking? Because I work harder than

[-Z-3-R-0-]: For the past year I've been making $20 an hour (often more) 
casually working from home for Data Annotation just doing it on my own 
schedule and vibin to music lol, pays more and is way easier than any 
entry level job in my area
[Olive___Oil]: I was talking to my dad and I showed him the current job listing 
for his first job add a major company that he started at in the 80s and 
it pays now and it’s the same as it did back then. I have way more 
qualifications for that job than my dad did when he got it and I can’t 
even get an interview. My double wide and then not so great neighborhood
 costed more than a 3600sqft house in a fairly well be very nice 
neighborhood that he bought in early 2000. Everything is more expensive,
 but that job pays the same that it did in the 80s.
I have been jumpscaring people by telling them to think about how 
much they paid or earned in X year and to plug it into an inflation 
calculator. People don’t know bad things are. Meanwhile minimum wage is 
still $7.25 in my state.
wooh federal minimum!
it's crazy to think that in my home state, the minimum wage ranges from $15-20 and people are out making pennies 😢
I play that game. My income in 1992 would be around $15k in 
today's money. I was living on my own, paying all my bills. I lived in a
 closet in a house my friends were renting. The first half of the 90s 
was no land of milk and honey. Coming of age in a recession has always 
sucked. The second half of the 90s was probably our best era in the last
 30 years.
I've spent my life working as a a cook and then chef/restaurant 
manager. I've always played the inflation calculator games with kitchen 
wages out of curiosity. The worst periods were the early 90s and during 
the financial crisis. They were equally bad. The highest cook  wages 
were right before the 9/11 recession, around 1999 and 2000. The second 
highest were immediately after covid. They are a bit lower now but still
 better than most of the last 25 years.
That's unbelievable. No like literally

I just read your post.
I want to say I am so so sorry to hear about your struggles. I 
felt a pit in my stomach, anger on your behalf, as I read your post. I 
can relate as I had trouble finding a job (took over 2 years) after my 
masters, got fired from a job in my field a while back, and now am 
struggling to find one again. Also back with parents.
Mostly I wanted to let you know you’re not alone and I can 
empathize. HOWEVER, I do have one piece of advice for your 
consideration-
You mentioned invisible disabilities. Im a sufferer myself.
Have you ever thought of checking the check box on applications 
for having a disability? I think its helped me before. Certain companies
 want around 7% of their workforce to be disabled. They don’t ask you 
about it or even see it at the manager level, and if you ever did need 
an accommodation, it helps on that front down the road.
That’s about all I got. Seems like you’re doing really well for 
yourself despite the frustrating (to say the least!) results.
One other thing Id say actually- are you able to take a few hours 
off from job search mode, for yourself, to do something enjoyable, and 
free, here and there? Sometimes I think we can get stuck in ruts. 
Shaking stuff up for a day or two, or even a couple hours, could help. A
 hike. A drive into the countryside. Something low cost/no cost that 
feels freeing. You’d ultimately know best what that might look like, 
those are just suggestions.
Anyways, let me know if you have any thoughts.

[nomnommish]: "Past generations" is a ridiculous exaggeration, and is the same 
tired false narrative people say to make themselves the victim and feel 
sorry for themselves.
Truth is, you're ONLY referring to a 20-30 year window in the 
history of America where America had the good fortune to come out the 
WW2 with its manufacturing intact. And you had this extremely brief 
period in history where America was the land of milk and honey, but 
mainly if you were a white American male. So you could walk into any 
factory or company with a paper resume and could get a job that required
 zero skills and could still plod and bumble your way though a good 
salary.
Heck, even if you look 20 years prior to that, the Great 
Depression was still going on, and people were routinely committing 
suicide or committing horrific crimes just to eat a piece of bread. 
Forget suburban house and 2 cars.
The blunt truth is that people across the world, across 
generations have NEVER had it easy. The struggle has been massive, the 
oppression has been massive, the violence has been massive, the wars and
 large scale killings and butchery has been massive.
But hey, whatever tired old cliche you narrate to yourself to fuel your victimhood, right?
Plus people don't seem to realize that much of the huge need for 
workers in the late 40's and 50's was because over 400,000 American men 
died in WWII.  It created a environment that opened up jobs to many 
people in society who would have been unemployable before the war.
This is dumb. Expectations these days are way higher than they 
were decades ago. Back then, you could go to college for a fraction of 
the price, even adjusted for inflation, and come out with a cushy job. 
Even then, people were hesitant to go to college because they could 
easily get a job and buy a house without going to college. Now it’s an 
expectation. You want to be a mailman these days and buy a nice house 
and raise a family. Good fucking luck! That was a reality 30+ years ago.
The real question is, why are we tolerating things getting worse 
over time? It’s not enough to say “well the Great Depression was bad, so
 this isn’t as bad compared to that”. Things are supposed to improve 
over time, not just in advancements, but in quality of life. That’s not 
happening, so it makes sense to question our trajectory.
Even in the 80s and 90s people were optimistic about the future 
and how we would have shorter work weeks, better/cheaper technology, 
better/chesper medicine and healthcare, etc. Things were already going 
fine, and people had hope and expectations they would get even better 
with time.
The 1% and big business executives and CEOs  have already made it 
clear we won’t be having that kind of future. They’re not even shy about
 it anymore. And people like you wonder why we’re all jaded?

yes they are that much harder for anyone in the working class

to how much you are compensated, look at slavery in the past. They 
worked tremendously hard but had virtually no pay.
Nah all computers and technology have done is increase the 
expectation of your productivity. Email made it so you’re expected to be
 on the clock after hours. It added an educational barrier to quality 
employment (an expensive barrier), whereas back then, it was not as 
expensive to get a quality job. It was easier when manufacturing was the
 main job

[TheWhitekrayon]: I mean yes we have it harder then boomers and Gen x.
But overall we have it much much easier then most of history. The 
silent Gen lived through the depression and fought 2 world war. Before 
that most folks didn't have electricity or indoor plumbing. Before THAT a
 big percentage of kids didn't live to adulthood. We have it harder then
 our parents. But we have it easier now then 90% of our ancestors.
[Either-Jellyfish9865]: What you don’t realize is that previous generations were already working 4x as hard. You just weren’t
[royberry333]: Nah g. My grandfather did the job of 4 ppl to get ahead at a young
 age. Lots of the older generation went hard to make money. Because of 
labour laws and tax, its no longer possible to get ahead like that 
though.
[hurricaneharrykane]: Abolish the fed then. The are devaluing the currency and making 
the dollars not go as far. Purchasing power for the middle class has 
weakened
[AlternatePancakes]: More like blame the elite that hasn't been willing to raise our wages and horded wealth.
These generations are just fortunate enough to live through a time
 where they had proper wages and the wealth distribution wasn't as 
fucked.

change based on your opinion.
I'm not stupid. I know that nobody here will be able to exactly 
tell since only a psychologist or doctor will find what i may have. I'll
 shortly explain.
Since 2024 i'm facing cognitive issues which implies :- Loss of memory even for autistic interests- Struggle to think or follow a narration- Struggle to focus i know i have adhd but i normally should have worked on it- Constant regrets or feeling of wasting time
And no member of my family ever had this type of issues before nor
 were they mentionned on my previous documents they even mentionned 
above average intelligence and good memorization ability.
I changed my studies because i didn't like it so I thought that 
stress, disgust or anxiety were the causes but even after having changed
 the problem is still not resolved.I took consultations with 
neurologists, psychologists and all of them failed to find an issue as 
my brain is still normal by looking at the scans.Some people might 
say it's due to age but honestly it sounds extremely weird as I'm just 
20 years old and technically I should be living my peak age in terms of 
abilities.
So here are my theories :- Depression caused by social issues, discord addiction and less reading (I started reading again)- Burnout- Atazagoraphobia developped (fear of forgetting and/or being forgotten)- Unknown disease that should be studied
I know people won't be able to confirm as I should take a 
rendez-vous with a specialist but it's been almost 2 years and I just 
want to get rid of this curse.

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. Maybe it’s just the 
psych grad in me but I can’t help noticing how so many of us wake up 
anxious ,,, before anything even happens. Like the day hasn’t even 
started & theres already that heaviness in your chest. Worrying 
about the future, jobs, money, relationships… or sometimes nothing 
specific at all?...
It’s wild how anxiety has become almost like background noise for 
us. Even when we’re not “spiralingg” there’s this constant hum of 
pressure ,,, to be productive, to have it all figured out, to stay okay.
 We overthink, compare, scroll, repeat… and somehow call it normal...
Sometimes I wonder if this constant mental tension is just part of
 being Gen Z now ,,, or if we’ve all just learned to live with a level 
of anxiety that older generations never had to carry.
What do u think??
If you had to name one thing our generation struggles with the 
most, what would it be ,,, anxiety, loneliness, burnout or something 
else we don’t talk about enough? please share your thoughts as i am 
working on smth related to anxiety as well.

Unironically there’s a lot of stress on us in the West to perform

expectations are outdated and no longer apply, and the expectations

[hept_a_gon]: Wanting notoriety and being paid for it?
[NotaJelly]: Money.
[aka_hopper]: It’s the phones! Earlier generations did not have it easier than 
us in a lot of ways. There was just…, less comparison, less horror 
stories, less coordination, all at our fingers. They had communities 
too, real ones. They spoke to eachother, strangers.
That’s what I think. I eat from a silver spoon compared to adults 
in my family, and wonder how on earth I have all this anxiety and they 
don’t. I don’t think it’s money. I think it’s the wild expectations I’ve
 subconsciously put upon myself.

TÍTULO: What's up with bed rotting? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Millennial here who just found out about 'bed rotting'.
First of all: Is this real or is it just one of those fake "Gen Z trends" that tend to go viral?
If it is real, what's the reason behind it? I can't think of any 
reason why I would want to just lay around in bed all day doing 
literally nothing.
This video explains what I'm talking about:https://youtu.be/zjGeZkDrL5I?si=ktkLm0GY9sxeoWQs

im not on tiktok but i would say it's probably just people 
expressing themselves and connecting with those who relate because it's 
alleviating to the feeling of isolation bed rotting and mental health 
issues bring. there's probably cosplayers but silencing mental health 
issues isn't the answer to handling victimizers, more education about 
the issue is so people can recognize when they're being insensitive and 
why they shouldn't do that. maybe you do have a point though because i 
do see a major issue with the rhetoric around autism and how it's not 
taken seriously and how it's mocked.
Who the f are "we".
Are you lecturing societal trends on how to be less harmful, lol. Good luck
This is the least real version of this problem. Bedrotting is 
expressed as mainly a meme, much worse actually serious things 
constantly go viral. Most people that watch content that uses the term 
bedrotting already have an idea of what the underlying "joke" is

I don’t know what to tell you man, it’s a joke. People are meming 
about depression, and you’re acting like they’re promoting some trendy 
new lifestyle.
I think the "trend" is letting yourself. Not spending the whole 
day telling yourself how shit you are for not getting up. Sometimes a 
day of absolutely nothing INCLUDING GUILT does help.

That's a totally reasonable concern, thank you for elaborating!
You're conflating it as a trend because a new term is being as a result of a thing changing.
People aren't just laying in bed sleeping or mindlessly watching 
TV. They are doing it while actively doom scrolling. The term seems to 
accurately describe what many are feeling, and thus gaining popularity, 
or "trending".
It's not a fashion trend.

[Ok-Equipment-9966]: ive been bed rotting since before its been called that. well, i guess it was just called manic depression before
I have bipolar disorder. Nope, not the same thing.
Bed rotting sounds a lot like surrender
Im bipolar as well type 2, after a hypo phase comes the depression
I also have -OCD -ADHD -panic disorder
Yeah you’re right. The only way to beat it is to get up and do 
something. Get the blood flowing and exercise the brain. I could just 
give up and lay there all day. But that sucks.
I agree. Even though I know it's difficult for these people the resignation to their weakness disgust me.
Manic depressionis a really good song.
I hope youre doing better lately.

[oxytocin_adrenaline]: it's not a choice.
it's a fall into the bare minimum existence because the rotten has given up living but can'tcommit suicideeven thought that is their desire.
the world is hopeless. they're a singular human being in a 
world that needs effort from a majority of their peers, family, their 
country. they can't change what needs to be changed.
they continue to exist just so that their loved ones don't 
have to bury them and waiting for anyone they've connected with to be 
company
but no one ever comes.
Real
People will do anything other than admit that something is deeply wrong with the world.
Frankly, I've been screaming that there is something deeply wrong 
for years, but they just keep kicking me out of the Wendy's
*Or themselves.  First step to help is admitting there is a problem.
Real
Rat park! Gotta find your mates and work it out together - community will save us
The world has been in WAYY worse situations and yet humanity is still here.
True, and some people killed themselves or thought about it along 
the way back then too. Many died before they got the chance to regret 
living
It has, but also, Gen Z is the first generation to have grown up with real constant access to the internet.
I'm a Millennial, I got my first flip phone in 8th or 9th grade, 
went through some various shitty smart phones and got my first iPhone 
like half way through college.
I didn't really get the ability to properly doom scroll like we have now until my brain was pretty much fully formed.
Our monke brains are not designed for the overwhelming stimulation
 they get. I remember a saying going around when smart phones became 
available to most people. Something along the lines of, you have more 
access to info in your pocket than presidents did not that long ago.
Obviously, that quote is reductionist, and not particularly 
accurate, but the point is, it was a revolutionary concept to have 
access to Google in your pocket with cell service notthatlong ago.
So, I can see how someone fed a diet of the internet from 
basically their earliest memories to current would have worse mental 
health and be more susceptible to bed rotting.
I think there are a lot of issues Gen Z is facing Millennials 
dodged due to technology. I graduated highschool in the late oughts, and
 college in the early 2010s. I don't really remember ever worrying about
 school shootings. Idk if they were even more or less common, but they 
weren't blasted on social media and the news like that.
If this link is to be believed, they grew in frequency long after I left school.
Idk, I know in many ways we live in the best times to be alive, 
medical technology, food availability etc, but we also live in 
horrifying times, access to news, all the political stress of someone 
like Trump being president. There is a lot to scare people, and make 
people feel hopeless. And this doesn't even get at how much harder it is
 to socialize today than it was for Millennials. The way I understand it
 as a dude in his mid 30s, you either use social media to do a large 
part of socializing, or you step away from it and lose the #1 way young 
people socialize. The antidote is basically the poison.
I know kids still go outside, teens still go places, but I think a
 lot of those 3rd places and external activities have been subbed out 
for tiktok, twitch streams, and other virtual environments that make it a
 lot harder to just exist in the world and be present.
I have a lot of empathy for Gen Z and the folks who come after them.
Same, no notes.
I will go to the grave believing that our brains were not 
evolutionarily ready for the "Information Age", and it's starting to 
show.
We don’t live in the best time to be alive obviously… you say that
 cuz we have treats and certain luxuries, the USA is a country full of 
treats, so we take the treats while we continue to be mistreated.

Severe depression.
A lot of these comments have to be trolls or just ignorant people.
 Depression (as in the mental illness, not just being sad one day) sucks
 the life and motivation out of you. I saw a comment wondering something
 like “I couldn’t imagine wanting to waste my day in bed.” People not 
realizing that depression can make you not want to do ANYTHING 
(sometimes including living) is amusing.
Dr. Ana has a very good video on this topic

[DoeCommaJohn]: It comes from a feeling of hopelessness. “Why should I socialize, 
nobody wants to be my friend anyways. Why should I date, nobody wants to
 date me anyways. Why should I exercise, I’m going to give up anyways.” 
In some cases, it comes from experience, in others, it comes from 
general social media (I’ll never be as hot as her, or being nonstop 
called an incel on Reddit), or it can also come from more specific 
setbacks like getting no matches on a dating app.

[QuigonSeamus]: You never heard people say they’re upset or depression or stressed
 out and they just don’t want to get out of bed? Like oh I’m going to 
spend the day in bed because I’m stressed out. You’ve never heard of 
this concept? Even outside of large levels of depression that would also
 lead to this, people take bed days and have forever.
[totalkatastrophe]: no i bed rotted so hard im in active decomp
the reason is often depression, but more than that its a dire lack
 of third places(not work, not home) that dont require money
You know you can just go outside for a walk right?
you know you can read a book right?
Love reading
i love reading too, it cant replace human connection though
Books also cost momey
unless you pirate them,
you know a walk and books isnt face to face connection with people right?
I actually met my neighbor the other day while outside
great for you. my neighbors are all old and disabled and dont come outside.

there's a lot of reasons but the main one is feeling overwhelmed 
and depressed, wanting to disconnect with harsh realities and an 
uncomfortable awareness and the feelings of hopelessness that come with 
it. lack of social support is a major contributing along with the 
comfort of the internet in a cozy bed.

Thank you!! I tried my best!

[El_Cactus_Fantastico]: I bed rot a lot, but idk if it’s just depression
[Feeling-Currency6212]: This is not a new thing lol 😂. Ever heard of my 600 lb life?
[GoldieDoggy]: It is real.
Normally, it'd be due to depression or similar disorders/mental 
illnesses (I've inevitably done it before due to ADHD, which feels 
different than someone doing it because they are depressed or have 
chronic depression). Currently, though, people are doing it as a trend. I
 don't know why, but it seems like it may be related to people making 
depression seem "trendy" right now, which is honestly a sickening thing 
to do. It's not a fun, happy thing, nor should it be portrayed as such.
Thankfully, I've never had to deal with the depression version, but the version Idodeal with often is incredibly annoying and frustrating. Iwantto get up to use the bathroom, clean my room, etc; but my brain or 
whatever is blocking it. Gotta love executive dysfunction 🙃 (not 
really, of course)
From what I've been told by my friends, many of whom do have 
chronic depression, their version of it is similar, except their urge todosomething isn't always as strong. They often just don't have the energy overall.
And that's why I give my friends hugs, stickers, etc whenever I 
get the chance to, because their lives are already rough enough.
[Pikapetey]: Well... to be honest... my bed is the most comfortable place in my
 house! 😅 I spent A LOT of money on my mattress! Dammit I'm gonna use 
it!
[Tabbygail]: my main confusion with bed rotting is... like are people living 
off lottery winnings? How are you just lying in bed for days without 
like, being evicted from that bed? Even when I was living with my 
parents I still had to make rent. "bed rotting" just seems like the 
first-worldiest of first-world problems.
[SpellingBeeRunnerUp_]: I think it’s good to do sometimes. I like to bed rot for a few hours on Sunday
[Grim_Laugh]: As a Millennial, if anyone calls this a trend, I will deliver a tire iron across their head.
These people who are genuinely doing this are hurt and need help. 
This is depression manifested into a state of paralysis. This is not a 
fad or a trend, GenZ just calls it “bed rotting” to make it sound quirky
 instead of “lost all will to live and just want to lay there until my 
existence fades away”.
It’s fucking sad and a cry for help, but like society always 
fucking does, it ignores the mentally health and invalidates it by 
calling it “what’s popular with the young people”.
[2fafailedme]: For me it started some time when I was in university. I would go 
from spending five minutes on my phone in bed every morning to ten. Then
 an hour... before long there'd be weeks where I'd spend multiple hours a
 day for most weeks in bed just on my phone. By the last year of uni I 
had a schedule that looked something like this.
2-3am -Go to bed and start trying to sleep
~4am -Finally fall asleep (Not a phone issue)
8:30-9am -Wake up, bedrot
12pm-2pm -Get out of bed
3pm -Go to uni/classes
6pm-Return home and study
12am-Submit any work that's due
After 12am -Bedrot
It's a shit habit I never fully broke but I definitely never wanna be like that again
[Nocryplz]: I seriously doubt they are doing nothing. More like on their phone all day in bed.
[Pitiful_Camp3469]: its not a trend. no one does it because other people are
[Powerful-Revenue-636]: Wallowing in misery needed a rebrand.
[gogus2003]: I can't feel my bones after work
[Yuki_Cross451]: Idk if what I do is “bedrotting” but after a long ass week I’ll 
switch between gaming/reading/crocheting in my bed or the couch for a 
full day to really enjoy my hobbies. Not depressed so I don’t think it 
applies to me?
[jjfromyourmom]: it's literally just depression
[Apprehensive-Mall219]: I have a 4 monitor computer at the end of my bed and me and my wife have been rotting for years now.
[CompetentMess]: As far as i can tell it's just a rebrand of a 'lazy day' that can 
be either shorter or longer than a day. It's a descriptive behavior, not
 necessarily a planned activity. Like, if you've had a rough week and 
want to lay in your bed doing literally nothing bc ugh, then you might 
say you want to go home and rot in your bed/bedrot. Or if you kind of 
meant to do stuff but spent your weekend in bed, when someone asks you 
what you did over the weekend you might respond that you were 
bedrotting.
It's literally just chilling. Relaxing. A way of spending time. 
'Hobby' is..  a different thing. You spend energy to enjoy your hobbies;
 bedrotting is about getting that energy back.
[Calico_Caruso]: This is just parallel to the "let it rot" mentality that was being
 popular/viral in China a couple years ago. Shit's hopeless. Why try?
[Tomsoup4]: next they will find out about “bed sores” mabey “bed bugs”
[Otherwise-Town8398]: Its called being lazy

TÍTULO: Why do we GenZ’ers tend to have poor work ethic? Or not put much as much effort into their work? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Although I’m excluding myself, because I’m a very hard worker (I’m 26F) and you’ll never see me slack at work.
But I noticed, at least a few, of kids who are between 16 and 19, 
seem to not out much effort into their work/work ethic as much as those 
who are older.
I should say that I live in a very white town, so many kids are 
privileged and don’t have to work for financial reasons but moreso that 
their parents just push them to get a job to do something.
Do GenZ’ers/younger folks tend to not put much effort because they
 basically have to work (or are commonly pushed by parents who
Is it due to having no experience?
I personally just cannot bring myself to half-ass my work, or not 
put 100% into whatever I am doing. Because why do something if you’re 
mot putting 100% in?
I’m also a labor worker (farmer),  so maybe it’s different for 
those in labor vs those behind a screen or a cash register—I would 
dislike that position too.
And I don’t mean to be offensive, or generalize a whole 
generation (I’m part of this generation too) but I’m just curious why 
the mentality is so different. I feel like an old soul in that sense 
almost.  (And trust me, I wish we didn’t have to work so much, I’m a bit
 anti-work, but it does give you a sense of purpose if you’re open to 
accepting that)
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[hikeonpast]: Every generation has its share of hard workers and it’s share of 
slackers.  Affluent parents can easily mess up their kids if not 
careful.
Facts!
Yeah I didn’t mean to call out an entire generation (that I am 
also included in), but I seem to notice it with younger folks moreso.
That, too, has always been the case.
Have you ever heard the colloquial expression “kids these days!!” 
 The youth have always taken a little time to learn where and how best 
to apply themselves.
Think about what must have been said about hippies in the 60s.  
Nearly all of them ended up being productive members of society.
Great points!
But you're right. This new generation is definitely trash
a lot of people tend to notice the unexpected like if there is an 
older "slacker" you are used to it but a newer "slacker" you arent used 
to them "slacking"

[[deleted]]: Absolutely correct and is what I came to say as well. They act as 
if we don’t matter so, in that same regard, I guess the quality of my 
work doesn’t matter. Businesses need to realize and prioritize employees
 that want to go beyond but aren’t incentivized to do so.
[asianstyleicecream]: Wait what? You wanna being violence & destruction into this? Oh boy.
But really I do agree with you that it’s quite crazy that places 
can’t pay a livable wage. I mean with labor work especially, especially 
farmers, we’re notoriously known for getting shit pay. Which is why most
 farmers are poor, handy, and live paycheck to paycheck. It’s a 
lifestyle, we do it because it’s our passion, we don’t do it for the 
money. Because it’s one of the worst businesses to start if you’re 
trying to make a lot of money, heck, any money.
Homie do you know anything about labor history in the US?
We have the 40 hour work week and labor rights in the US because 
about 100 years ago a bunch of workers got together all over the country
 and made businesses and govt afraid of what would happen if demands 
weren't met.
No, school taught us nothing worthy of listening.
But we should bring that back because it’s time for another Revolution!

[Positive-Avocado-881]: While it is true that you have to start somewhere, you don’t have 
to stay. My pay increased by 42% going from my first and second 
corporate jobs and I was only at the first one for 18 months. I’m 
already considering moving on to my next job because I’m facing some 
recent BS at my current job that’s honestly not worth the thought or 
effort to resolve if people want to argue with me on it.
Terrific! Yes absolutely. You don’t owe the job anything, you’re welcome to switch jobs.
[asianstyleicecream]: Terrific! Yes absolutely. You don’t owe the job anything, you’re welcome to switch jobs.
[Rowdyroots]: I’m not risking burnout for minimum wage. Lol
[Spungus_abungus]: I work a factory job for a big Corp and the idea that hard work 
rewards you with raises and bonuses is somewhat true, but only 
applicable for things that are documented. If you're doing work beyond 
your scope or favors for others you're getting used, but if you're 
submitting safety reports that's something on paper your supervisor can 
use to justify a raise.
[[deleted]]: Because I grinded my ass of in school because I was lead to 
believe that my hard work would pay off. I worked OT, long shifts, and 
endured discrimination all during covid, to the point I have a seizure 
disorder caused by ptsd. All for ass pay with no bonuses/raises. Any 
extra mile I gave, they took without any financial compensation. And 
because I ate up the self-loathing around "not being a hard enough 
worker" I didn't document my discrimination.
Fuck corporate America, they will not pay you what extra you do, 
and will take anything extra you give. The people are not there for the 
jobs, the jobs are there for the people. So tired of this mindset that 
we all should be thankful to have jobs. Wrong. These businesses would be
 useless without workers, not the other way around. They will justify 
their shitty treatment of you just so they can achieve record profits. 
It's all about the profits for them.
I'm done being guilt tripped into not being a good enough worker. 
You wanna destroy your own body and/or mind, go for it. I got paid for 
my hard work in trauma and a disability.
Felt this 100%
[Ok-Birthday4107]: Felt this 100%
[Last_Eggplant3277]: Because the harder you work, the more work they'll give you, and there won't be any reward for it.
It used to be that working hard got you more. More money, better 
position, etc. now, working hard ends up with a bigger pile of work, and
 no increase in pay.
GenZ realizes their worth, and refuses to make people rich while they get peanuts in return.
[[deleted]]: I have no loyalty to corporations, don’t identify with my job, and
 know my employer will lay me off the moment someone with an MBA and an 
abacus decides profits might be better without me. I’ve never had a job 
where you were rewarded for being a good worker, rather every job tends 
to reward people who are the most likable. Oh and my raises haven’t kept
 up with inflation for 3 years straight now.
Employers keep giving the bare minimum on their end so I don’t go above and beyond on my end.
[[deleted]]: I don’t put more effort in than the bare minimum for a few 
reasons. One, I don’t get paid enough for exemplary work, they pay me 
like a bare minimum employee so I will only deliver said bare minimum. 
Two, the job is not one that will lead to advancements in my chosen 
career or in any career, negating one of the biggest reasons you would 
put in more work and time. Three, I don’t like making other people money
 and getting pissed and shit on while in the process. Treat me with 
dignity, you’ll get better work. Unfortunately, most companies will 
treat you like dog shit and as such, my work will be of the same 
caliber.
[Positive-Avocado-881]: Honestly? It’s because a lot of Gen Z is only willing to work as 
hard as their pay reflects. Work also isn’t the top priority that it 
used to be. People value their mental and physical well-being a lot more
 than in the past. You can’t put 100% of yourself into work because then
 you can focus on other important aspects of life.
Absolutely. (I wish I wasn’t getting paid $17/hr, sacrificing my 
healthy body to get by. But I wouldn’t change it for a desk job or a 
retail job; I’m driven by passion not money, but I’m aware I still need 
to make money. So it’s all a sacrifice. My mental health has never been 
better because I’m working a job I am passionate about and work hard at 
it.)
But then you hit 18 and either go to college + get a job, or you 
just go right into the workforce. No one’s exempt from working—unless 
you have mass amounts of money of course. I just think it’s smart to 
learn how to work and what works for you while you’re young, then wait 
and be fired/demoted for lack of effort/work ethic.
You can absolutely put 100% in your work. Do you work on those 
other important aspects of your life while your working? (Because if so 
that’s your problem, you’re supposed to do one thing at a time, maybe do
 your important aspects of life after work)

WhTs gonna happen when it’s time for them to go into the work 
force? They just gonna refuse every job because hardly any of them pay 
fairly? A generation of homeless, poverty folks?
As much as I despise the workforce and how it functions (the govt 
especially) , we still have to be a part of it. We can fight it while 
we’re in it, I think that’s what these people don’t understand. We all 
have to work, hardly anyone is getting paid fairly nowadays, we’re all 
in this together. I’m hopeful this generation will make the changes we 
need, but we gotta be a part of the system first and take it down from 
the inside.
no, just no effort is put in lol. you work some crap job for crap 
pay, you dont put in any effort until you find something better, its 
easy tbh
You’re just gonna get replaced, and likely from those who came 
here overseas. They’re real hard workers, and they work for low pay. 
(I’ve seen it happen, especially in labor jobs) Not saying that’s a bad 
thing, I’m all for welcoming in more people in the country (USA), but it
 sucks that there almost isn’t enough of certain jobs (like there’s 
plenty of Amazon jobs available, but that’s passion-less and has no room
 for growth/promotion). Pretty nuts.
I have yet to find better work, it’s really not as easy to find andgeta job as they say.
To get aentry level job, they require 1-2 years experience & a degree. How the fuck does aentry leveljob require that? How is one supposed to get an entry level job when 
you don’t even qualify? How is one supposed to get a job out of college 
if they require experience as well?
The whole thing is a shit show. I figured my hard work would pay 
off and get me better positions, but you’re right, they expect 110% 
effort for shit pay.
dog i live in canada 💀 idk if you think ur telling me something

[AccomplishedDemand21]: I don't know enough to say it's a problem with our work ethic 
specifically with our generation, but one thing that IS part of our 
generation that I'm with the older folks on is that I am over every kid 
having their ears plugged up when they work a job that requires frequent
 communication to either coworkers or customers. I like music too, but I
 sincerely don't understand how these younger kids HAVE to have ear pods
 glued into their ears or else it's unfair and they don't want to focus 
on anything except getting the music back. If you could go 8 hours 
without it at school (unless you're one of the kids who can't), you can 
go 8 hours without it at work.
100% agreed.
[asianstyleicecream]: 100% agreed.
[naivewiseone]: it’s funny bc at my job, it’s the opposite (i’m 22). i notice the 
people my age are more useful than the people much older than us, and 
they are like 28-35.
Oh interesting! What job may I ask?
[asianstyleicecream]: Oh interesting! What job may I ask?
[Xecular_Official]: I believe a company should get the level of effort they pay you 
for. If you get paid an average salary for your title, you should 
provide average quality work.
If you get paid barely enough to make a living, your work should reflect that
Absolutely. Unfortunately, we’re very replicable, and they will 
find someone who will tolerate $17/hr because that’s all they can find. 
I’m there right now, I can’t find a job that pays more in the field I’m 
in (farming), so I’m stuck with this pay. I couldn’t go work a job I 
hate and am not passionate about because I just can’t get myself to do 
work unless I have a drive, and money isn’t a big enough drive for me, 
passion is.

[DankElderberries420]: Work with a Gen z kid (20). Slower than molasses.
Work in a wearhouse.
He only picks the smallest orders. Stands there with his order 99%
 finished  but wont box/send order until someone else is about to finish
 a must larger order, like he's swimming in our wake. No work 
drive/ethic.
We can see the monetary value of each order, pretty sure he's 
trying to "stick it to the man" by dragging his ass like an anchor but 
he's just making more work for the rest of my team. We also recieve a 
portion of completed orders value as a bonus, so the more we churn out 
the more we earn. Not enough for him, stands there most of the day
I work with a 17 year old, in a barn caring for farm animals.
My observation is that he lacks confidence in himself. Everyone 
else he works with is at least 9 years older then him, so I wonder if he
 doesn’t put as much effort [as we do] forward because why try hard when
 someone else already has the reins? Because the other day he had to 
work solo (or at least worked in the barn with another coworker who 
doesn’t work in the barn but does other things) and I guess he did a 
good job at taking initiative and getting everything done instead of 
having a coworker to tell him or actively do it for him.
But, he also has ADHD (and I think some depression as he was put 
on antidepressants recently) so some days he’s more attentive & 
initiative then others. But I do too, but I’m medicated for it so it’s 
more steady, and labor works well with my type of brain as it keeps me 
in the present moment.

[probablysum1]: Why work harder at something you don't care about when the reward is more work?
Well the first problem there is s that you don’t care about your

work. That’s a perspective issue, but nonetheless is absolutely

[Donttrickvix]: Why participate in your own exploitation if you and the hard worker get paid the same
Because you kinda gotta have a job and get paid to participate in 
society & the economy. It’s the unfortunate truth. Better make it 
worth doing everyday because we’re doing this for life bro
Well yeah I’m just giving you the reasoning

[Only_Forward_478]: Hey there! It's really good that you take such pride in your work —
 that kind of dedication is always admirable and will pay off. Regarding
 the work ethic you've noticed in the younger crowd, there could be a 
few things at play. It's true, sometimes when work isn't a financial 
necessity but more of an 'experience' thing, the urgency and commitment 
can vary. It's part of learning the ropes — that work ethic often gets 
honed over time as responsibilities and realizations kick in.
Plus, different folks are motivated by different things. For some,
 especially in labor-intensive jobs like farming, there's a tangible 
sense of achievement that can be instantly rewarding. For others, 
particularly in less physically demanding roles, the gratification might
 not be as immediate or obvious, which can affect their drive.
It's also worth considering that everyone's got their own story. 
Those kids might have pressures and expectations you're not seeing, 
shaping how they approach work. And feeling like an 'old soul' just 
means you've got a mature perspective, which is a great thing. You're 
right about work giving a sense of purpose — finding that balance 
between recognizing the need for work and also the desire for a world 
where work isn't all-consuming is a conversation worth having, no matter
 the generation. Keep on being the hard worker you are, and maybe your 
example will inspire some of those kids to step up their game too.
Great response! That 2nd paragraph is totally how I feel. But 
also, I feel like I have more worth in my labor & creative/critical 
thinking, then I do in tying emails or working behind a cashier; i have 
more to give with my labors.

[Raptor556]: I work how much I'm paid and if I feel like I'm not valued or respected that's even more reason to put in less effort
[[deleted]]: Agree they are lazy and then they expect not to go to college and 
get paid high. They think $15/hr is low for zero college, that's 
pathetic, maybe they should look at all the $8-10 for no college. 
Dumbest thing they are so lazy having same job and somehow get away with
 it at bad companies, now if one has a good mgr they'd fire them. If 
they are purposely getting errors and only high metrics by cheating then
 what are they learning? To cheat and scheme, maybe they can get away 1 
company, but def not many. That's why I'm leaving my current. Does a 
huge company actually expect to keep being a successful business once 
you only have lazy millennial workers with constant errors, no? They 
will crash and burn if they don't learn to hire ppl who want things done
 correctly esp when it is health insurance which I'm in, you're 
literally allowing mbrs no coverage by them thinking they have coverage 
and truly not getting discrepancies fixed by lazy workers. They can't 
comprehend how insurance is effecting elderly, they just don't care. So 
once only lazy workers that half ass it the company will be gone because
 they don't look into who is actually doing things correctly

TÍTULO: Why Does Anyone Do Anything Anymore? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Something that I find a bit mystifying is why anyone is actually motivated to do anything now.
If you think the about the general reasons for human striving - 
things like meaningful work, spirituality, religious belief, the 
prospect of owning your own home, finding a committed relationship, 
starting a family, participating in a community - almost all of these 
things are desperately lacking now.
There just doesn’t seem much point in doing anything because work 
doesn’t pay that well anymore and the work that exists is mostly 
alienating or dehumanising, spirituality has vanished from our society, 
house prices have priced most of us out of the market, dating apps have 
completely destroyed dating, and community is nowhere to be found.
On the other hand, you now have the widespread availability of a 
lot of extremely addictive things - internet porn, smartphones, video 
games, drugs. It’s remarkable that more people don’t just decide to drop
 out of society and indulge in these things all day long. How do people 
keep going?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Venus_Retrograde]: Because in reality, despite having hardships people have 
meaningful lives they spend with their loved ones. So their perception 
of  reality isn't doom and gloom.  Most people are spending time with 
friends or their partners doing fun stuff and are surrounded by nice 
ambiance. They dont feel like the world is burning.
Try this experiment. No news, no reddit, just funny youtube 
videos, just netflix, and spend your days with friends and family for 2 
weeks. Compare your perceptions and attitude afterwards.
No. Most adults are NOT spending time with friends. Some are, but 
most are not. This is reflected in studies that have been making the 
news lately.
Socialization also happens with family members. It's not limited 
to friends. Does the scope of those studies include interaction with 
family? Or purely friends?
I highly doubt the average adult is isolated from the world.
The average likely isn’t isolated but there’s definitely a lot more people isolated these days than were a decade ago
Not really, the difference is that you never got to know about 
isolated people in the past because precisely of them being isolated,, 
while they show up on online polls and other activities now

[Varsity_Reviews]: Oh yes, I should be miserable because I have the most amount of 
opportunities to do whatever I want in my life than anyone else in 
history, but because some people are struggling more than me I should be
 miserable
[[deleted]]: No, OP, it predicts the opposite. The conditions of the modern 
West are the best they have ever been for humans in human history. Of 
course, there will always be societal stressors and individual 
exceptions, but the majority of people have running water, a roof over 
their head, a stable job, access to healthcare, etc. The list goes on 
and on. There are people who are literally dying for a chance at the 
same luxuries many of us have, yet so many are so keen to tear it all 
down.
The internet is not reality. It is just an echo chamber of how 
things are so "bad." Also, community does exist, and it is alive and 
well in many places. Put down your phone and  start paying attention a 
little more.
[goingtotallinn]: Why should I be miserable? I am academically gifted enough that I 
can get good education, I have good family, my future looks better than 
current situation.
At one point I stressed too much about school work but then I 
realised that everybody is just winging it and everybody else has the 
same problems.
[[deleted]]: Because they have the things you just insisted are lacking
[chillchinchilla17]: Because most people aren’t struggling the way Reddit presents it, and aren’t doomers about the future
[[deleted]]: People don’t want to be miserable
[Legitimate_Issue_765]: Because, short of a chemical imbalance in the brain or genuinely 
extreme and rare situations in the west, whether or not you maintain 
hope in life is a choice; and hope, and the ability it gives us to push 
through the odds is what makes us as humans so resilient.
And I'm not saying that with sentimentality or just repeating a 
platitude; there is, at a bare minimum, extremely strong anecdotal 
evidence that a non-negative state of mind is the most important thing 
in survival situations.  There may also be scientific evidence as well; I
 simply haven't looked for the research papers myself.
[chieftain_ajns]: I feel like life gets way harder and longer when you embrace being miserable.
[Atmanautt]: Sounds like you're intellectualizing your depression. Doesn't matter how much suffering there is, misery isnevera virtue.
[OkBubbyBaka]: People have perspective (I think that’s the right word) and aren’t
 depressed. My life’s thankfully going well but even if I was working 
60hr weeks for a penance I’d still be thankful.
A little over 80 years ago my grandpa had to lay silently for 
several hours under the still warm bodies of his entire murdered family 
until the Nazis left. He could have given into his misery, yelled out, 
and received a quick end. I’m thankful he fought through his misery so 
that I can be here enjoying my misery.
Perspective.
You may be depressed unfortunately, if need be speak to a professional or two.

That sounds like an awesome day. Nothing crazy, just proactive and relaxing
[AbatedOdin451]: That sounds like an awesome day. Nothing crazy, just proactive and relaxing
[ruben1252]: For fun.
You might benefit from reading about absurdist philosophy
[Ultramega39]: Not everyone spends the entire day on social media.
[LonguesSurMer]: “Tonight’s main story: Recluse Doomer discovers not everyone is terminally online”
[SparkyMcBoom]: Millenial here, all you really need is one or two people in your 
life in like regular, physical proximity that you legit care about and 
bam, reason to live. We forget it all the time, but other people are the
 only things that matter.
I married young and had a kid- life was hard but meaningful. I 
wish I’d put in the effort to keep up a better friends circle and that I
 had moved less. Hope that helps
[Chop1n]: Having lived through the dark night of the soul at least once or 
twice, at this point, I'm content just to stick around long enough to 
see what the fuck happens.
While everything you mentioned is basically true, it ignores one 
critical point: it's all very temporary. The rate of change is 
blindingly fast at this point, and whatever the status quo is now isn't 
going to last more than a few more years. In the next decade or two at 
the most, we're going to see the end of the world as we know it, one way
 or another. It would be deeply unfortunate to miss out on whatever the 
hell that turns out to be. Or perhaps very fortunate, because I think 
it's either going to be heaven or hell with no possibility of a more 
moderate outcome. I'm just too curious to give up, having made it this 
far--four billion years in totum.
Curious what you think the outcome options for this in your " see the end of the world as we know it" look like scenario?
Like I said, heaven or hell--as to what particular forms of those 
things are possibilities? I have absolutely no idea. That's the nature 
of this degree and pace of change: when the exponential graph goes 
vertical, it's literally impossible to predict. The only thing that 
seems certain is the extreme nature of everything that's happening, and 
therefore the extreme nature of the eventuality that awaits us.
The obvious possibilities are the ones we already know of, where 
we destroy ourselves, or at the very least our own civilization. If 
superintelligent AI is possible, that might just kill us all and harvest
 our matter for its own purposes, indifferent to our existence.
On the other hand, full automation of the productive economy could
 mean the end of scarcity, which would radically change every aspect of 
human life. We might live to see a world where scarcity and 
disease--including aging--essentially end, and where the slings and 
arrows of the human condition change fundamentally.

[Atmanautt]: Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will. Your options are
 either to give up/give in, or to exert as much control as possible over
 your life. The latter is always the better option, period, even if it's
 difficult you have to try.
[timmahfast]: Because there's lots of joy to be found in the little things in 
life. Miserable people sit on social media and see these big things 
influencers are doing, like buying houses and going on trips. Simple 
things like reading, hiking, gardening or any simple hobby can be 
affordable and make you feel fulfilled. But people have the world at 
their fingertips and  comparatively it doesn't sound that great.
[Successful-Listen811]: burnout
[Old_Captain_9131]: Responsibility.
As an adult you can't just do whatever you want when you feel like it.
[Angel_OfSolitude]: Shouldn't the lack of these things drive you forward? None of these things are gone.
[xoLiLyPaDxo]: Creative people enjoy creating because it is an "inner drive" that
 exists regardless of monetary benefit. It is something that you 
naturally feel you need to do because you enjoy it.  Most people create 
and innovate and invent as a hobby even if they gain neither money nor 
praise from doing so. Inventive people will always invent. Non religious
 people still do things " for the betterment of society", and don't need
 to believe in a deity to want to build a better future for the world 
and all that dwell upon it. Not everyone actually enjoys " being 
selfish" as it is usually unfulfilling and short lived to do so for a 
lot of people. Not everyone thinks they need to put others down in order
 to feel good. Usually, the opposite is true. Real happiness comes from 
within and it feels amazing to help others and se them do well as well.
I think it is a false narrative that those that want to justify 
atrocities have pushed to believe that people will " only do" for money 
or that innovation only happens because of war ect. It's BS. Creatives 
will always do these things as long as they are given access to the 
resources to be able to do so. I am an artist and designer by hobby. I 
dream of things that have never existed. I wake in the middle of the 
night and want to write down details or make a sketch of what I just 
dreamed about. I have sketchbooks full of furniture  and architecture  
and landscaping designs that don't exist. I dream of future cities and 
homes Creatives do that naturally without any prodding to do so and 
nothing to personally gain.
TBH, I think we would move much faster progressing into the future
 if we allowed all of those struggling to survive to be " out of 
survival mode" long enough that they could have time to create and 
invent, as at present, making people who would otherwise be inventors, 
designers and artists have to be factory workers, amazon drivers and 
grocery store clerks is doing  a terrible disservice to the world. The 
desire to increase investor profits and increase the wealth of the few 
is why they keep regurgitating the same tired old designs over and over 
again with nothing new coming out is all in the name of the same few 
lazily making $$ off dated designs. Do you think people just generically
 brought back 80's fashion trends? No, that was all staged and they made
 the old designs, marketed them and people bought them because that was 
what was available.
In my artists groups though, people create amazing things most 
never get to see  because they don't have a factory to churn out many of
 their designs like those regurgitating Uggs and generic uncomfortable 
1980's couches, they just make the one and rarely sell it, so only the 
few will ever know it existed at all. The world could have access to 
more of these things if we upended the social hierarchy and control, and
 finally ended the idiot without a creative bone in their body trying to
 sell knockoff shoes someone else designed with their " brand name " on 
it. Fk " brands" BS and bring back original artistry.
With something like UBI, people would be able to start doing 
things on their own again because they wouldn't  be forced into survival
 mode 24/7 just to keep from dying  homeless in the streets. The wealthy
 pricks think they need to keep people dying in the streets so that they
 will have an unlimited pool of cheap labor to exploit, and it empowers 
them to maintain the system because without desperate people there is no
 reason for people to give them power over others in the first place. 
Those that want to actually create  better future don't need to maintain
 their power by force, people support them because they want to build a 
better future as well.
[boolocap]: I get to study a subject i love, that results in jobs that pay 
well, i have friends that i play dnd with, family that i care about and 
that cares about me.
Sure there is plenty of shit that sucks but that doesn't mean we 
should just lay down and take drugs until we die. If you give up before 
even trying then what's the point.
[xXGuavaEaterXx]: I started going to a Catholic club at uni and then a Traditional 
Latin Mass Catholic Church and it drastically changed my outlook and 
improved my life
It’s not like the more superficial ways of going to church that’s 
more common these days. It’s more ritualistic and conveys more mystery. 
And the priests that do it actually act like God is important and don’t 
do the hippy-dippy stuff
Not hating on the churches that do the English mass. There are plenty of good ones out there
[nutshells1]: People have an genetic drive for self-actualization - achieving 
goals they set for themselves. That's entirely separate from society; of
 course, many of the goals are often society-related. I see Hedonism as 
you've described it as a a symptom of long-term failure to achieve - 
overindulging on the same sources of dopamine is a sign that your life 
isn't moving in a way that also shifts the goalposts for pleasure.
[ChileanBasket]: I have family i love and they love me back.
That's enough for me to do whatever i can to make them happy.
[imperialhydrolysis]: Because I can rationalize that, while all of this may feel 
pointless, the second I stop trying in life things will go from bad to 
worse. School is hard, so does that mean I should give up and prevent 
myself from being able to pursue something I love and that will make me 
money? Work is tiring, does that mean I should just quit and make no 
money, preventing me from buying necessities and being able to do fun 
things with friends? Every generation has felt like this from time to 
time, although I do understand we’ve spent most of our lives realizing 
that simply doing your best isn’t always enough. But we definitely are 
not the first generation that needs to work in order to live, and we 
certainly wont be the last. I get that it might feel hopeless, but the 
moment you stop trying in life you’ll realize why it was worth it. Hang 
in there.
[CreamyShrimpGnocchi]: …meaningful work, spirituality, religious belief, the prospect of 
owning your own home, finding a committed relationship, participating in
 a community…
Literally every single one of those besides the home ownership is 
available to anyone. You just have to work to bring them into your life.
If you’ve decided you absolutely cannot find peace or joy in a 
humble home that you rent, then sure, you’ll be miserable until you buy a
 house. But understand that that’s something within yourself that YOU 
need to fix, and not a reflection of society.
[BonkChoy123]: sounds like you’re depressed my man
also spirituality has not ‘vanished’ from our society, there has 
never been a point in the history of the US where actual spirituality 
was the mainstream
spirituality just isn’t adhering to some religious doctrine, it’s a deeply personal journey through your own psyche
[Bzman1962]: You mention spirituality. I highly recommend finding a community, perhaps Buddhists.

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Gen z here
Honestly, it’s not just me. Gen Z is growing up in a world that’s actively crushing us. Look at the reality we inherit:
•	Economic crisis: Rent keeps going up, student loans pile up, and
 entry-level jobs barely pay enough to live. My friend just graduated 
with honors and is stuck delivering food because nothing else pays.
•	Corrupt or failing governments: Policies favor corporations over
 people. Climate bills get delayed while billionaires dodge taxes. You 
start realizing no one is fighting for your future.
•	Global instability: Conflicts everywhere, nuclear threats, and 
wars that feel like they could start any day. It’s impossible to feel 
safe or plan ahead.
•	Housing impossible: Even if you work 40 hours a week, you still 
can’t afford your own place in most cities. Many of us will live with 
parents well into our 30s.
•	Education is devalued: You go through years of school, spend 
tens of thousands on college, and still struggle to get a decent job. A 
degree no longer guarantees stability.
•	Mental health crisis: Anxiety, depression, burnout… it’s 
everywhere. Therapy is expensive, and support systems are overloaded.
•	Climate change: Fires, floods, extreme weather. We know the 
planet might not be habitable in a few decades, and we can’t ignore it.
I don’t want to live in a world of you will own nothing and be “happy”
Edit: also inflation: Saving for anything is pointless. Investing?
 Even worse. Everything is overpriced, rigged, and controlled by boomers
 who’ve been gaming the system for decades. No matter how hard you try, 
the rules are stacked against you, and the future they promised doesn’t 
exist.
Edit 2: As a summary of the post, Our parents and grandparents had
 a house, a car, and family holidays by 25. We have debt, anxiety, and 
four roommates by 25. Or in other words, we need to work ten times or 
more to get the same or less than previous generations, that’s the 
problem.

[basedbranch]: No one riots anymore...
Yes we do lol
Last time was like 3 months ago, and that was over so quick ppl 
forgot about it within a week. BLM was the last major wave of real, 
continous, tense rioting that actually challenged the establishment, and
 that was 5 years ago. So no, no one riots anymore.
People need to have dedicated goals when they protest. I have no idea what the BLM protests tried to accomplish.
The riots were even dumber and probably hurt the cause more than it helped.
This is the story of literally every protest since the occupy 
movement. We all know what people want, but a movement has to have clear
 and tangible goals to actually accomplish something. Protest with the 
specific goal of "Qualified Immunity Must End", and you might get 
something done. But a protest of just "we dont like how racist yall are"
 with no policy demands wont change anything
It’s been suppressed. Los Angeles music festival.
Lol protests arenotriots.
They can easily turn into them
5 years are nothing in the grand scheme of things. If no one 
rioted for 500 years you could say that we don't riot anymore.
Americans are much too privileged to engage in and endure real riots.
Eh, give us a couple years/ decades for things to truly get worse.
 It’s bound to happen eventually if our country stays on this 
path.
As long as people have entertainment, food, porn and the rest of 
their comforts, there will be no rioting. Not to mention that the 
government monitors all your technology so good luck organizing
Bread and circuses. But without the bread.
[[deleted]]: Yes we do lol
Last time was like 3 months ago, and that was over so quick ppl 
forgot about it within a week. BLM was the last major wave of real, 
continous, tense rioting that actually challenged the establishment, and
 that was 5 years ago. So no, no one riots anymore.
People need to have dedicated goals when they protest. I have no idea what the BLM protests tried to accomplish.
The riots were even dumber and probably hurt the cause more than it helped.
This is the story of literally every protest since the occupy 
movement. We all know what people want, but a movement has to have clear
 and tangible goals to actually accomplish something. Protest with the 
specific goal of "Qualified Immunity Must End", and you might get 
something done. But a protest of just "we dont like how racist yall are"
 with no policy demands wont change anything
It’s been suppressed. Los Angeles music festival.

[Lambdastone9]: “Most efforts are futile” translates to “I think I’m powerless”
This is the most franchised era you’ll live in, even with all the disenfranchisement from this administration
A revolution will take all of that away from you, and make you a combatant. What power are you gonna have then??
[peeper_tom]: You dont wait for those, you make them happen
[TravelingSpermBanker]: People won’t have a revolution because things aren’t bad enough yet.
[Psychological-Mud790]: Don’t wait. Be the change you wanna see. I gained so much more 
hope, confidence, and optimism once I actually joined in on direct 
action :)
[[deleted]]: I need some of these big city motherfuckers to get it cracking. 
I'm tired of watching the country fall apart from Republican territory. 
There's so, so, so many people who are against this. We just need to 
learn how to organize.
There are organizers everywhere if you look.
[julmcb911]: There are organizers everywhere if you look.
[VoiceMasterTV]: It's taken too long for people to wake up and realize that if just
 20 million people out of the 380 ish million we have would just stand 
up and say no more we or we fight the government will bow. No army in 
the world can handle a 20 million person army. America struggles to keep
 up a 2 million man army and it's stretched across the world. Even if 
they are untrained they'd still be formidable. I think a big chunk of 
the numbers will probably be from military families. They didn't get 
involved in the military per se, but they do know how to handle weapons.
 Like myself.
[TrashManufacturer]: I’m waiting for the collapse.
[hailstorm11093]: It'll take a hell of a lot more to go wrong before there's an actual revolution.
[Lambdastone9]: “Waiting for the revolution”
Why…bloodshed, famine, nationwide deceit, division, lack of trust, desperation, depravity…
A revolution is just a war, but this time you don’t get to have a fully built government backing you up
Revolutions are the last thing you’d want
The war has already started. We just refuse to rise to the provocation.
[[deleted]]: The war has already started. We just refuse to rise to the provocation.
[Metamorpholine]: “If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution”, Emma Goldman
[OffModelCartoon]: Yeah because revolutions are achieved by waiting around for them.
[karl4319]: Millennial here. Went through 3 economic crisises, 9/11, the war 
on terror, the corrupt Bush administration the lied about Iraq, a near 
political revolution, the election of Obama, and I would say all before I
 graduated college, but the 2008 crash led to circumstances the led me 
to drop out of college for years before I went back in my late 20's.
Yeah, I really am waiting for the revolution too. I think the 
expected economic crash that may soon happen will be the trigger much 
like how the 2008 crash led to occupy wallstreet. I just really hope 
this time leads to real change. Obama was promising, but ended up with 
much the same as Hillary would have, and we needed more then and we need
 a whole lot more now. Pretty sure Trump is going to kick the bucket 
before the end of the year too based on current health rumors. That plus
 a crash should make the environment ripe for true revolution.
I think exactly like you. I also think a brutal recession like 
2008 is coming. Debt is insane, wages are stagnant, prices keep 
climbing… and this time it could hit even harder. It’s not paranoia, 
it’s just looking at the numbers and reality.
Yeah I’m shitting my pants about the next recession. They suck so bad
Yeah this one is going to be so much worse... In 2008, housing, 
food, healthcare and education were significantly more affordable and 
pay was relatively higher. Many people who lost their jobs then had a 
cushion.Most people today do not. With the higher cost of living when 
people lose their jobs they will be homeless in weeks this time....not 
months like 2008.
Time for some new deal policies!
We had a hoover before a roosevelt
The older you get the more you realize that there is always a 
recession looming ( if you're paying attention ), a war brewing, a 
tragedy to be upset over, people dying from disease, ... the reality is 
if you're waiting for the "right moment" you will forever be paralyzed 
with something on the horizion.
At the end of the day you just have to live your life and save for
 the future even if it seems silly. You will lose some you will win some
 and in the long term you will end up ahead compared to living on the 
sidelines.
"future", do you hear yourself?
Brother people have been waiting since Marx wrote the manifesto. 
People have lived and died believing the revolution will come any day 
now, and then their children's children's children's children are still 
saying "any second now it all comes crashing down and we can rebuild!"
Turn the tv off, or internet, and do something with the cards you were dealt. No one is coming to save you.
This person kept it frfr
What are you expecting to happen in the revolution?
Revolutions aren’t lead for the top.
If what you mean by revolution is the nordic model of mixing 
private and public industries with strong social services with some UBI,
 I'm all in. If on the other hand you are referring to a communist 
dictatorship, I'll have to pass.

[ChillEntrepreneur]: Honestly I think the world isn’t as bad as it’s made out to be. 
Media makes money off fear so that’s what we get fed 24/7. Focus on the 
stuff in your life you can control, your skills, habits, work ethic, 
ect. Ignore everything else. No politician is going to save you.
This sounds sweet but the financial realities can't be spun. I'm a
 millennial and i'm paying $30,000 a year so my two kids can go to 
daycare while my wife and I work.  We can't afford to buy a place so we 
are renting a house for $25,000 a year. We are literally paying a 
college tuition's worth of money so someone else can raise my kids and a
 second college tuition so I can live in someone else's house.
The media can "make money off my fear" that financially this life 
is not possible, because it's true. The narrative isn't selling because 
it's false, it's selling because it's true.
Outside of finances, the situation is similar.Two things can be true, our climateisgoing to shitandthe media pumps out climate disaster scenarios because fear sells.
No politician is going to save you.
Literally my boomer parents say this, especially when I ask them 
if the social security I've been paying into will be there for me when I
 retire like it was there for them. Literally the only person who can 
save this is a politician. I'm required to pay into it and they're 
supposed to pay me back lol.
These are the same boomer parents that bought a house for $95,000 
and sold it for $690,000. The ones who did that without having to pay 
for daycare, because my dad's job as a furniture salesman covered 
everything and paid my brother's and my college tuition. Meanwhile, I'm 
literally paying a college tuitionfor fucking daycare. While 
the billionaires get richer and the taxes on the wealthy vanish. I can 
"focus on my habits" (LMAO) as much as I want, but the reality is 
literallyonlypoliticians can save this. The thing we can focus on changing isthem, not ourselves. Fuck off.
You pay 55k a year in rent and daycare and think you have it bad economically?
Man.. most people's household income is between 50 - 80k
Presumably your wife makes more money working than it costs to pay
 for your kids daycare then, right? So compared to where many in 
previous generations had women stayed home to take care of kids you're 
coming out ahead.
And then once your kids get into the free public school system in 
like 3-4 years max you'll be able to put that 30k per year daycare money
 towards saving up for house payment within a few years if you want. So 
seems like you are squarely on the path to home ownership if that's what
 you want. Most countries in the world single family home ownership 
isn't even a thing at all. You have recent post talking about how you're
 buying the latest pixel pro phone model... It's just a little tone deaf
 to be complaining like this when you sound like you're in a much better
 position than most.
That’s a good point of view honestly
No, it's not.
Even if we were to accept that the world is that bad, maybe not 
for us who live in a western relatively safe enviroment, it is good 
advice to focus on the things we can control and cherish while educating
 ourselves.
Love some stoic philosophy here
This is the philosophy you try to teach people if you don't want 
them to change the system. When you say hey, this shit around seems 
crazy, like...how can I afford to live, because whatever the media says 
doesn't affect my financial reality, and what if the world is a Mad Max 
wasteland for my grand kids, because whatever the media says doesn't 
change the climate science data?
And they answer, "Nah bro, focus onyour habits" hopefully that raises a red flag and not an appreciation for an impactful philosophical point.
I agree with everything you said. Our generation has a serious 
issue with being a hivemind. Stoic philosophy is great for protecting 
someone's peace - ofc we shouldn't encourage someone to think about 
issues to the point it harms themselves.
At the same time, it's important to encourage those who are 
educated to educate others on the situation and push for standards and 
improvement - something only possible through criticism. It's a dark 
reality and uncomfortable to think about, but the people who are most 
uncomfortable are often the ones fighting for what's right. At this 
rate, nobody wise will ever have children because it just spells 
financial failure unless you hit it big.
Our gen needs to realize that a different mindset isn't an attack 
on your own. We all do things we're capable of to the best of our 
ability (or at least, we should. I hope you all have passion...). In 
saying that, I appreciate your comments, pasta, and pizza.

[SuzQP]: Human evolution hasn't prepared you to perceive a visceral 
difference between near threats and far happenings. Your fabulously 
adaptive brain, though, can focus attention on what is actually 
happening in your own real life. I think you need to do a lot more of 
that.
Human evolution hasn't prepared you to perceive a visceral difference between near threats and far happenings
People save for college tuition for their kids, for their 
retirement, make wills, buy insurance in anticipation of future 
struggles if they don't. We're actually pretty good at planning ahead 
and anticipating threats, it's kind of why we are successful as a 
species.
Your fabulously adaptive brain, though, can focus attention on

Not worrying about existential threats you can't control certainly
 reduces anxiety, but it doesn't change their reality, and some of these
 thingsareactually happening in people's lives.
Imagine if everyone did that in 1930’s Germany. Or if people just 
“pulled themselves up by the bootstraps” in the 30’s instead of 
unionizing?
Sometimes things are bigger than just you. Being selfish and purposely oblivious isn’t as virtuous as some think

[7LayeredUp]: It literally all boils down to economics. All of history can come down to economics for better or worse.
[digigyrl]: Gen X here. It's fucking crazy what's going on. Nothing is 
affordable. My belief is it boils down to greed. The "haves" vs. "have 
nots" and the gigantic income disparity that's going on. The margin is 
way out of control to where the normal people can't make it.
It must, and needs to change. Honestly, how many millions or even 
billions does anyone need? It's not necessary to have that kind of 
wealth.
More industries need a union revolution. That’s a big reason why we had an incredible middle class in the 50’s and 60’s

[No_Discount_6028]: Yes and no. Most generations have suffered through far more 
unfavorable economic and political conditions. It's obvious, however, 
that the Internet and its consequences have been a disaster for our 
generation in particular, and watching our civilization decline is 
psychologically difficult even if it's apparently declining to a level 
which is still among the greatest in human history.
also inflation: Saving for anything is pointless. Investing? Even worse.
This is bullshit. If you put $100 in the market in December of 
2019, it'd be $159 today, inflation adjusted. Over the same period, the 
value of a dollar went down by about 20%. So if you put $9,000 in an 
emergency fund that accrued no interest (which, you should be using an 
HYSA), it would still be worth $7,142 today, which would absolutely 
still help in the event of a job loss, for example.
I get that it's hard to save if you're in a financial pinch... but
 if you can, please for the love of god put some money away, for your 
own safety.
[DarknessGamers]: Just gotta find the right industry and stop looking at the world 
so negatively… I grew up with nothing dad left me when I was born and 
mom left me at 16.
I now own a house make great money and married.
Take a break from social media too..
[context_lich]: I understand the feeling and I feel it too to some extent and if 
you're just hoping someone other than you sees it, then I do. At the 
same time, I have to move forward. I have to live as though there will 
be a tomorrow and frankly as someone who's been living for a little bit 
and made a lot of mistakes: Things are often better and worse than you 
think they'll be. What I mean is that things are never quite as good as 
you hoped. The world is often dark and full of struggle, but things also
 haven't been nearly as bad as I feared either. I've made several 
mistakes I thought were game overs, but really just ended up being a 
different sort of existence. I move forward in my own way and there are 
things in my life worth enjoying still. I enjoy every meal. I enjoy 
listening to music on my many different long drives I have to take 
almost every day of the week. It's not perfect, but it's not the worst 
case scenario either.
[Legal-Ad-5235]: Something has to give right? 🥲 right? Like born in 2003, the good old days never happened for me 😅😂
[flipmangoflip]: There’s plenty of excuses for everyone in every generation as to 
why they can’t be successful. My mindset is: what am I going to do about
 it? Sit around and bitch or do something to improve my situation? Do 
whatever you want brother but I got better shit to do than wallow in 
misery because life is difficult.
[Cookie_Cutter_Cook]: I don’t have enough mood stabilizers for this 🫠
[Cove-frolickr]: You forgot dead internet and no actual culture that defines who gen z is.
[Gauge_Tyrion]: Not to mention a new trend of 'minimalism' which honestly just 
saps all of the creativity, character, and life out of the world. Those 
who particularly suck at design just end up making it look more 
brutalist instead.
[Positive_Narwhal_419]: Technology really fucks with Gen Z too. Not enough in person 
connections. Everything is online now. Really can mess with a person 
mentally
[Melvin-Melon]: Personally I don’t feel dead on the inside
[MacaroonFancy757]: The government won’t fix anything because it’s controlled by 
demented Boomers. They only care about themselves, and they vote for 
policies that help them yet screw over the younger generation.
When they pass, it’s possible voting patterns will change.
FDR did a lot after the Great Depression. We can’t just keep 
kicking the can down the road and expecting people to sail a sinking 
ship
[MoonQuartzs]: We basically inherited the Millennials problems and more.
[caca-casa]: Well GenZ certainly didn’t vote like they wanted to improve their situations.
[hitlicks4aliving]: It’s all a scam bro the money is basically fake to keep us on a 
hamster wheel while the elites harvest our energy 👌🚬. We need to go 
back to the gold standard.
[Intrepid_Passage_692]: Too much yap just go triple digits on motorcycle that takes care of my mental issues
[Rootayable]: I feel like this millennial sentiment, too.
[GoldenInfrared]: It’s social media.
Social media is to socialization what junk food is to nutrition; 
it fakes out brain into taking something that doesn’t actually fulfill 
our physiological needs because it’s easy, then we wonder why we’re so 
tired and depressed all the time.
[Mysterious-Egg8780]: even tho there is much trash going on right now. I wont give up 
and will try to make the best out of it. Also, there are enough good 
things to appreciate in this world.
[YoSettleDownMan]: Go outside.
[espinaustin]: Look within

TÍTULO: Why is Gen Z more overwhelmed by common stressors than other generations? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I have noticed in past employees this instant overwhelm in the Gen
 Z crowd whereas Gen X and older millennials will come in and just “get 
it done.” We hired a younger guy for a painting project who said “I 
don’t like to feel pressured” when he misses the due date of the 
contract he made himself. We had women at work who just answer phones 
crying because too many phones are ringing rather than putting them on 
hold and proceeding. My niece also saying she can’t handle a fast paced 
kitchen and any type of perceived pressure. If you are Gen Z, why do you
 think your generation is less able to take on stress? Was your 
childhood more easygoing and not preparing you for stress so now it hits
 you extra hard, or something else? This is a genuine question so please
 don’t take it as a bash.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Seraf-Wang]: Thats not gentle parenting, thats enabling parenting.
Don’t forget helicopter and snowplow parenting.
I've heard helicopter parenting. Is snowplow parenting like the 
parent is always trying to to be one step ahead to "solve" their child's
 problems, like a plow through snow?
I think what's meant is clearing all obstacles out of the way of 
their child's path. But sometimes the kid is the snow so there can be 
multiple meanings here.
It's not like a lot of us don't have bad parents in such a way that makes "bad" an understatement.
There's some kind of consensus that kids or even younger adults 
these days have it easier. Maybe that's generally true. Not always.
Gen-X here. Have it easier how? Gen Z is taking on a burden that 
no other generation has had to take on. For every convivence kids today 
may have, matters little when milk hits $10 a gallon. Look at it this 
way, when I graduated in 95 I could go work ANYWHERE for minimum wage 
and live fairly well. A lot of the wages for jobs, are like $2 more than
 they were in 95. See where I'm going with this?
When it comes to parenting I can only comment on my generation. A 
lot of us where latchkey kids and kind of overcorrected with our 
parenting. You can't coddle in this day and age and expect your kid to 
function when they are on their own. Also, screaming at them for every 
little thing and not teaching, just creates people that thrown down at 
Walmart because that's how they were taught to react. It's a fine line. 
You need to nurture and uplift your child but also not hide them from 
the bullshit that is coming their way. I feel Gen X has failed at this.
Also, the world being online has done a disservice to the younger 
generations. There are skills you do not develop when most of your 
interactions are not done face to face. Then you enter stressful 
situations in real time and act like you would on-line. Honestly though,
 Gen Z is not doing bad considering what they are about to inherit as 
they enter adulthood.

[alexandria3142]: Permissive parenting is the second one
[DifficultSpill]: The dumbest convo that I regularly have online:
"I don't believe in punishment." "That's the matter with this generation, they're never told 'no.'"
...Those are two completely different concepts! But I will accept 
that some people may have so much childhood trauma that they feel bad 
doing anything that might upset their kid.
[scrappybasket]: It’s usually about the parents, I’d say this is the most likely answer
[highdefinitionjoke]: Underrated comment. This combined with ‘overshooting’ gentle 
parenting others have mentioned. To add to it all, I think there might 
be some apathy at play. Like, if it’s all burning down, I wanna be here 
for a good time if I’m not gonna be here for a long time. I don’t have 
the bandwidth nor the inclination to accept a life any more stressful 
than is absolutely necessary.

Yeah my kids are 15 and 16 and so fucking nihilistic. Like, I am

who they’re voting for. Like it’s a fucking TikTok feed.

[Narren_C]: here in the US a good chunk of them have lived through school 
shootings and the ones who haven't lived with the ever-present threat of
 school shootings hanging over their heads.
Everyone's lived with the fear, but are you saying that a good 
chunk of Gen Z has literally lived through a school shooting? Because if
 we're talking about the ones that actually experienced a school 
shooting, it's an absolutely statistically insignificant number.
Obviously they're horrible for even a single student to 
experience, and obviously hearing about them on the news affects us all,
 but we can't blame a societal issue on having literally been present or
 attending the same school where a school shooting occurred.
[Donovinian]: Millennials and Gen X experienced the same thing except they were 
also busy trying to mitigate gen z’s exposure to it. I get where you’re 
coming from but this doesn’t add up for me. It’s my job to train a lot 
of young gen z guys and I see the same exact behavior. It’s wildly 
consistent in my own personal experience. Tasks that I assign them that I
 would have considered a walk in the park make them crumble. And they 
won’t try to get through it or figure things out. This is easily 6/10 of
 the guys I train and the good 4 end up leaving because they don’t want 
to deal with their peers bullshit. It’s gotten to the point where I want
 to start a petition to not hire anyone under the age of 30. I’m not 
sure if younger adults simply can’t or won’t handle the pressure but 
there’s definitely something going on. I would love to help if I could, 
for me it comes from a place of love. Seeing these young guys feeling 
defeated because they can’t accomplish something absolutely kills me, if
 I could take some of the fear or anxiety away I would in a heartbeat.
[UWUliusCeasar]: Idk as a zoomer I can get work done efficiently but can't handle 
being yelled at. Did my parents coddle me? Not at all my childhood had 
emotional and sexual abuse. I work well but I am affected by things and 
don't want to take shit.
I don’t know i think not being yelled at in a workplace, 
everywhere actually, seems like basic human decency. If we are two grown
 adults you don’t need to yell at me, I don’t care if you’re the boss.
I'm GenX but my kids are GenZ. I taught them that they don't have 
to take being verbally abused by anyone. I also taught them that work 
should be compensated and collective bargaining works for workers. They 
work hard but they won't tolerate having their elbow jogged mid-job. 
They rebel against micromanaging but if you give clear instructions and a
 soft deadline(like ask for it 20-30% faster than you need it)they can 
give you great results. Treat them like relatively competent people that
 you value.

[Candyman44]: I’d argue you’ve spent your entire lives online.  You have not had
 to deal with real people in the real world.  You haven’t developed the 
skills to deal with pressure or people who aren’t super kind to you.
Older generations had to rely on each other personally not 
electronically.  They bonded through tough situations or pressure 
situations and the BS that comes with building teams or people that can 
handle those situations.
OP’s example just sounds like a spoiled kid who never had to 
perform in a team situation and doesn’t like the fact that others are 
dependent on his part of the job in a timely manner.
Majority of zoomers still attend in person classes and work. We 
hang out with people online and I'll. So we do "deal with real people in
 the real world"???
[UWUliusCeasar]: Majority of zoomers still attend in person classes and work. We

[Dissendorf]: I’m Gen X and I never worked like that, but these younger kids do seem pretty soft to me.
[No_Revenue_6544]: Nah it’s because ya’ll are just weak.
/s, of course.
Jokes aside and speaking from an older generation, even growing up
 in the 80s and 90s when things like seeking treatment for mental health
 was becoming more accepted it still wasn’t discussed. It was, in many 
cases, something embarrassing that you had to deal with. Like having a 
physical medical condition you didn’t want anyone to know about.
Even through the 2000s and much of the 2010s it was still kind of 
like that. It really wasn’t until the last 5 years or so when things 
really started to open up and discussing your mental health struggles 
was more accepted. Thanks largely to apps like TikTok I imagine. And the
 more you talk about it, the less ashamed you are. That’s made it more 
accepting to talk about the things they can upset you mentally and 
emotionally, such as things that make you stressed out.
Now there’s a downside to this as well, which is expecting anyone 
to care about it. I feel like most Gen Zs, especially the older ones, 
know this but for anyone who doesn’t - the world doesn’t really work 
that way. Especially post education. Maybe it should. But it doesn’t. In
 your life you’ll be faced with all kinds of weird and stressful 
situations that you need to get through regardless of how you feel. 
Employment is the perfect example of this. Unless you’re self employed 
you’ll always have a boss. And that boss may be great, they may be 
terrible. But you can’t just ask for a new boss.
This. Sometimes life gives you a shit-sandwich.
[[deleted]]: This. Sometimes life gives you a shit-sandwich.
[slide_into_my_BM]: Isn’t that taking the facts and fitting them to the conclusion? 
Other generations saw their parents be coal miners and die of literal 
overwork. It’s kind of crazy to assume Gen Z is all of a sudden the 
first ones to notice this and make a change.
For the record, I think OP is over generalizing and even in the 
instances they’re describing, I don’t know what the root cause is.
It just seems crazy to me that somehow Gen Z, out of all the gen’s
 before it, somehow was the first to notice “working too hard is bad.”
For example, we have a Gen Z intern at work. She doesn’t even need
 an internship for school but she sought one out for the summer just to 
pad her future resume. She’s a good worker but she’s easily distracted 
and has no drive to find tasks to do. If you don’t give her a new task 
to complete when she’s finished the old one, she just surfs on her phone
 till it’s time to go home.
I think this is what OP is describing.
I don’t even think she’s lazy, I just think she lacks either the 
confidence to seek out additional tasks or the drive to do so. Honestly,
 I don’t care what she does. We don’t pay her so I don’t expect anything
 from her. This internship is entirely voluntary so she’s only getting 
whatever experience she decides to get out of it.
Some of that might just be inexperience. In school, you do the 
work assigned to you and aren’t expected to seek out additional tasks 
when you finish. May be worth a frank conversation about what she should
 do when she completes her tasks.
[katbeccabee]: Some of that might just be inexperience. In school, you do the

[paradisetossed7]: Millennial here and I think OP is leaving out some of the boss 
shit Gen Z does.  I had a colleague who was an older Gen Zer and he told
 me that once he leaves the office, his work phone is off.  Doesn't 
check emails, doesn't work, etc.  (We don't work a typical 9-5, but 
smart phones have made working alllllll the time even more expected.)  
At first, I was horrified and literally had anxiety at the thought.  But
 then I thought, holy shit, he set a perfectly reasonable boundary and 
is sticking to it.  Honestly, I was impressed.  Yet still I accepted two
 remote meetings during my four-day "vacation" because it's baked into 
me.  As a highly anxious person, I don't get all the anxiety Gen Z has, 
but I strive to have the boundaries a lot of you have.
[chikkinnuggitbukkit]: Your niece is right. It’s rude to raise your voice at employees 
and she shouldn’t have to deal with that. Gen Z is also more in tune 
with our emotions and can properly express themselves when they don’t 
feel confident in doing something.
Are we? I feel like we’re too busy consuming external media on our
 phones than stepping back and reflecting on our emotions, causing 
mental illness.
In other words I think we are in tune with the aesthetics of 
mental health.  I have no evidence for this but I imagine most Gen Z 
mental health crises aren't that deep.  However, with the internet 
weakening social circles the small stuff has now becomesoimportant.
This, combined with the fact most of us are in the ongoing process
 of building an identity; for which mental health can serve as a tool(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9298910/)  leads to...
Exhibit A:
I saw someone in the comments talking about school shootings and 
climate change.  As if these are on the average american's mind at all:
https://
www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-
americans-views-of-climate-change/
#:~:text=Concern%20over%20climate%20change%20has,change%20as%20a%20major%20threat.
Edit:
2024 American voter concerns ranked:
https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/
or that it meaningfully impacts the low voting rates youngins tend to have:
https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/
TLDR get off the internet.  Telling that partially to myself as 
well.  Mfs don't care about climate change or school shootings(however 
important those things are).  Ya'll need friends and significant others.
Loneliness is at all time highs too which just amplifies all the 
problems. I am 25 and have no friends, never had a gf, etc, and while I 
feel like my situation is fairly unique my life is becoming more common 
too
Mental illness has always been a thing, it's more "prevalent" now 
because we have more resources and are actually getting diagnosed.
Please do some research on the topic of historical mental health before spewing the "pHoNe BaD!!!!111" rhetoric.
Male and female suicides are at an all time high. Our generation 
has a disproportionate amount of body dysmorphia and we also care a lot 
more about superficial things than the generations before us, leading to
 more stress about small things.
Phones are 100% a detriment for attention spans. Yes better 
screening for mental health= increased incidence. But neglecting the 
threat of social media & technology is straight up ignorance.
Devil's advocate as a millennial: I see Gen Z as being good at 
making excuses and using psychological terms to justify certain 
insecurities. I don't necessarily see a generation that is adroit at 
navigating their emotional complexity, certainly moreso than others.
Navigating emotions is a lifelong pursuit, if you choose it. Every
 generation does get better at it because the education is more 
available. But I see Gen Z also abuse this to justify their arrested 
development.
To me it feels like a bunch of people with no legs, complaining 
about their mobility issue, but refusing to use a wheelchair/scooter 
because "it's hard".
Like I empathize with people and recognize that the old way of 
just suppressing our feelings and ignoring mental health is bad too. 
However, as an older millennial, it feels like Gen Z+ are perfectly ok 
with choosing "die" in a "do or die" situation. Which is wild to me 
because I was raised to "never give up" and "don't let them get you 
down".
Idk what even is the right thing for society, but this is my personal observation.
Gen Z has probably had the easiest life of all generations. We 
Millennials also had an easy life. But Gen Z really leans into the idea 
that being oppressed means they have righteousness. I'll also accept the
 criticism that Millennials also tried to just buy into the neoliberal 
ideals. Sure, Gen Z is pushing back, but I think they're also just 
slacking for the sake of slacking.
Easy life in terms of available technology and quality of life,

[mmaguy123]: Are we? I feel like we’re too busy consuming external media on our
 phones than stepping back and reflecting on our emotions, causing 
mental illness.
In other words I think we are in tune with the aesthetics of 
mental health.  I have no evidence for this but I imagine most Gen Z 
mental health crises aren't that deep.  However, with the internet 
weakening social circles the small stuff has now becomesoimportant.
This, combined with the fact most of us are in the ongoing process
 of building an identity; for which mental health can serve as a tool(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9298910/)  leads to...

I saw someone in the comments talking about school shootings and 
climate change.  As if these are on the average american's mind at all:

because we have more resources and are actually getting diagnosed.

Male and female suicides are at an all time high. Our generation 
has a disproportionate amount of body dysmorphia and we also care a lot 
more about superficial things than the generations before us, leading to
 more stress about small things.

screening for mental health= increased incidence. But neglecting the 
threat of social media & technology is straight up ignorance.

[[deleted]]: Devil's advocate as a millennial: I see Gen Z as being good at 
making excuses and using psychological terms to justify certain 
insecurities. I don't necessarily see a generation that is adroit at 
navigating their emotional complexity, certainly moreso than others.
Navigating emotions is a lifelong pursuit, if you choose it. Every
 generation does get better at it because the education is more 
available. But I see Gen Z also abuse this to justify their arrested 
development.
To me it feels like a bunch of people with no legs, complaining 
about their mobility issue, but refusing to use a wheelchair/scooter 
because "it's hard".
Like I empathize with people and recognize that the old way of 
just suppressing our feelings and ignoring mental health is bad too. 
However, as an older millennial, it feels like Gen Z+ are perfectly ok 
with choosing "die" in a "do or die" situation. Which is wild to me 
because I was raised to "never give up" and "don't let them get you 
down".
Idk what even is the right thing for society, but this is my personal observation.
Gen Z has probably had the easiest life of all generations. We 
Millennials also had an easy life. But Gen Z really leans into the idea 
that being oppressed means they have righteousness. I'll also accept the
 criticism that Millennials also tried to just buy into the neoliberal 
ideals. Sure, Gen Z is pushing back, but I think they're also just 
slacking for the sake of slacking.
Easy life in terms of available technology and quality of life, 
sure. Easy life in terms of cost of living and social mobility? Nah. We 
have one of the largest gaps in wealth/income equality of all recent 
history. We have the most expensive Healthcare, education, and 
housing.
I don't blame them for slacking when there is no incentive to work
 hard. The 'American dream' is as far away as it's ever been. Why would 
people want to work really hard when there's little to gain from it?

[SalaciousSolanaceae]: I really think this has actually gotten worse across the board. I 
had a couple asshole bosses in my distant past, but my husband has been 
dealing with almost comically aggressive bosses over the last few years,
 moreso than ever before.
I hope this trend starts reversing. It's outrageous.
[Maybe-Alice]: You raise an important point about the boss making people cry vs 
this idea that gen z is just crying all the time. The real question is 
why are workplaces becoming so toxic and demonizing those that are 
affected. Classic “identified patient” family dynamic BS.
[[deleted]]: Had a boss when I was working maintenance that treated me like a 
child and really worse than that. Insulting me every moment he got 
calling me dumb in indirect ways, implying that I was weak because I was
 “worse than a woman”, spying on me, bad mouthing me to other employees,
 yelling, accusing me of things I didn’t do, etc. The narrative that Gen
 Z just doesn’t want to work or is soft is naive.
[LucastheMystic]: Pushed to go to college only to graduate in the midst of a 
Biblical Plague and a hostile job market. I'm 26 now... I will not be 
working retail at 30... hopefully, that means I'll have a better job... 
the alternative is not so pretty.
[ManaSkies]: Yup the key is that previous generations had, "If I achieve this I get a better life."
Gen z and younger millennials however DONT have that.
My father bought a 2 floor $3500 sqft house for $200kin 97. That house goes for 1.5m today.
He made $30k a year on average TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. I make 35k a
 year now at the highest paid non doctor job in my town. His old job to 
this day pays around 30k a year.
I cannot hope to afford what he did no matter what I do. I would 
need to make $245,000 a year to be at the level he was a quarter century
 ago.
[ourobourobouros]: I'm a millennial and recently got hired at an entry level cashier 
gig for temporary work while between real jobs. All of my managers are 
Gen X and are OBSESSED with talking about how terrible they think Gen Z 
is (which is the age group of most of my coworkers). The kicker is that 
they all have children of their own that are, of course, Gen Z
I want so badly to tell them "You are the problem. You failed your
 children." I've also noticed they are terrible at training employees - 
they'll go out of their way to omit instructions in order to let us do 
things wrong so they can come back and condescendingly correct us. It's 
bullshit, cannibalistic generation warfare
The same thing happened with millennials and our boomer parents. 
They raised us then accused us of ruining everything and being the worst
 generation of workers (despite having the highest productivity in 
history)
Don't take the bullshit. Fight back - quiet quit, snitch on your 
bosses to their bosses using HR/tiplines/Open Door policies, learn OSHA 
codes and snitch about every little thing the company does wrong, 
discuss wages and organize behind their back (this is legal even in 
Right To Work states). Learn your rights as a worker and wield them like
 a goddamn weapon
[Royal_Flame]: “statistically worse” nearly everything is statistically better
Except for human relationships.
Turns out humans are animals that need more than rights, commodities, and entertainment
[SlavaAmericana]: Except for human relationships.

[Olbarkeye01]: there is just no reason to have to deal with it🤷‍♂️
[[deleted]]: I think the pandemic struck at a really bad time in Gen Z's life. 
The oldest Gen Zers were in college/leaving college. The youngest were 
young but not so young that what was happening was just in the 
background.
For those about to leave college, the economic upheaval was a huge
 disruption in life plans. Just ask anyone who was leaving college in 
2008-10.
And for those still in school, you lost a few years of normal 
childhood development while adults argued over what was best for you.
I think the pandemic was a bigger stressor than the Great 
Recession. Losing a job and facing a rough job market are sources of a 
lot of stress. But the pandemic was more than a bad job market. We kinda
 shut down as a society and I don't mean work from home or restaurants 
closing. I mean we kinda gave up on each other. Yes those first few 
months we were all "We're in this together!" But after that it became, 
"Why do I have to wear a mask?" "This isn't a big deal unless you're old
 or fat!" "You just need to sip warm horse pee pee and you'll never have
 to worry about COVID." It was a shit show. And if you're young and 
already unsure about your place in the world, watching the adults around
 you give up on each other and lose their minds is pretty fucking 
stressful.
I say this as someone who isn't Gen Z. I feel for you folks. I'd 
say things will get better but I'm old enough to know that isn't always 
true.
100% the pandemic was worse than the recession. I watched my dad and grandpa die within 2 months of each other.


That’s so horrible :(
This is what it is in my opinion. I’m older gen Z and was 
finishing my bachelor’s and starting my master’s in 2020. It was 
impossible to get internships for a lot of people which meant a lot of 
my friends in engineering who couldn’t get them got pushed back badly in
 the job market. One of my friends had her internship canceled on her 
and couldn’t find another one. She graduated without one and never found
 a job in her field because most require an internship. It took my 
husband 3 years to find a job because of not being able to get an 
internship and it pays like shit. In my masters I did a lot of studies 
on resiliency and the pandemic and a lot of the younger Gen Z lost 
critical socialization and had extreme stressors on them at a pivotal 
time in development. Honestly I think now my generation just has a high 
baseline of stress due to how the pandemic affected our early lives. We 
start stressed so burnout isn’t far behind.
the pandemic was honestly so insane and traumatic and i think it’s
 crazy more people don’t generally talk about the fallout / 
repercussions we’re still dealing with and will continue to deal with. 
it feels like the world pretends it didn’t happen and just forced 
everyone to push forward meanwhile my head is totally fucked
(i’m a millennial but finding myself to be very sensitive to my work environment and also social environments after covid)
Because our corporate overlords needed us back to work and talking
 about mental health didn't become a thing until millennials got on 
tumblr, so the overlords don't and won't ever care.
I like your point here, I also definitely think this impacted a 
lot in terms of missing out on learning how to handle various social 
situations l, conflict, disagreement, etc in school because they were 
forced to sit home, and then had no expectations for school because no 
one knew how to navigate all of that. So coming out into a world full of
 that would feel like a lot!

[boolocap]: So you saw 2 people do something and went, "oh the whole generation must be like that".
I'm 28 and working in engineering. There has been a sharp decline in the quality of our graduates in recent years.
They're not educated, unprepared, can't handle simple deadlines or stress.
End of the day this isn't minimum wage. We are paying them a 6 
figure salary to do this and it's clear they're not qualified for the 
job.
You’re a young engineer yourself, you don’t think you were viewed the same way when you started?
I don't think so. It's one thing to require training when you first start a career.
What I'm talking about is a lack of base level competency or work 
ethic to even be here. Nevermind tech skills, I've seen grads need to 
use Chat GPT to write up rudimentary emails.
Older millennial manager here in a STEM field. I wouldn’t say it’s
 a decline in quality but the folks I’m hiring now need a lot more 
guidance and structure than they did five years ago. They’re still great
 at their jobs but do get easily overwhelmed and have a harder time 
pivoting in the face of surprises than, say, mid/young millennials. I’m 
seeing some good explanations for that in this thread.
We’ve revamped our onboarding process to include more training, 
try to offer very good work/life balance, I am not an asshole, etc. Most
 of my Gen Z hires are very hard workers and know their shit but I do 
find they need more structure. It’s going to be an evolving process. 
We’ll have to do it again in a few years with the Alphas.

[Abitsqltedwolf]: yelling should be reserved for when people are actually in some sort of danger
sorry that i don’t feel like getting berated over something that quite frankly, im not paid enough to do anyway
And even then, if it's a life-threatening situation like 
commanding a team to assist with CPR, you have to remain calm. Raising 
your voice at any one is not helpful, unless you're trying to protect 
yourself from somebody dangerous or something. I honestly feel like a 
lot of boomers/old people are so emotionally underdeveloped to shout and
 yell all the time (source: my parents and other boomers).
yeah i agree, i more so mean like yelling “WATCH OUT” or “HELP” or
 situations where you need to get someone’s attention to let them know 
that you or someone else are in danger
boomers seem to think that they have to yell to get a point across, my mother does the same thing

[jgkjgkjgk]: The juice isn’t worth the squeeze
It all comes down to that. All these capitalists crying "no one 
wants to work waaaaaah" but refuse to pay anyone. We know THEY don't 
respect us or our labor, and they are so delulu and entitled they expect
 that we shouldn't either. OP is just telling on themselves that they 
have no leadership skills and can't handle actually managing people, 
something work from home showed was true of most of the middle 
management class. OP probably about to get fired and wants any excuse to
 blame their underlings. Another commonality these middle class 
capitalists have, projecting and blaming everyone but themselves. Hell 
if we're "weak" it's cuz we got weak leadership.

[BomanSteel]: I'm my opinion? A few things.
The main one: it's easy to remember the people that "just dealt 
with it" because back then you didn't hear about the people who couldn't
 deal with it. You either sank or swam and you can't hear people if 
they're sinking.
Also, the standard answer: social media wrecked our brains. Minds 
weren't meant to handle getting feedback and opinions for 100s of people
 at the touch of a button, doom scrolling=more engagement=more general 
anxiety, etc...
[wafflemakers2]: A boss should never berate their employees. The only time a boss should be yelling is if someone is in legitimate danger.
Gen Z is making sure they know that
[OlympusDB]: Ooh we can take on stress quite alright, trust me on this one.
The guy doesn't want the deadline because the deadline objectively
 means fuck all to him, and anybody raising their voice towards anybody 
isn't just idiotic, it's unnecessary.
The reason why Gen Z doesn't have to put up with it is because 
most of us don't have children to feed and other such obligations, 
therefore we don't need to put up with much.
[Lucky_Emu182]: they don't make slaves like they use to.
[Ok-Athlete-2145]: Gen Z knows there aren't any safety nets for them. And they know what failure looks like.
From an American POV: We've grown up being told that our entire 
futures hinge on getting into a great school, but somehow not failing 
into an endless pit of debt. And if you get a job but get fired, you 
will never recover from that stain on your record.
(And if you become homeless, you will get fuck all social 
assistance/housing support, and the SCOTUS wants to sell you to a 
for-profit prison so the rich can lease you out as forced labor...)
Obviously this line of logic will sound extreme/doomer/absurd to 
some, but the stakes keep getting higher and everyone is feeling the 
squeeze. I guess specifically to Gen Z, open access to the internet and 
austerity politics/the rise of fascism globally have given us endless 
examples of people who fell on bad times and COULDN'T get back up again.
 It's unreasonable to look at this environment and expect children and 
young adults, who aren't established yet and have been told they don't 
have any future to look forward to, to match the confidence of older 
generations.
[Miss-Figgy]: My niece also saying she can’t handle a raised voice from her boss
Counterpoint: we Gen X had abusive Boomer and older Gen X bosses. I
 can't tell you how many bosses I've had that were inappropriate and 
created toxic, hostile, and dysfunctional work environments, and we were
 told to just take it because they were our superiors and we needed 
jobs, which just encouraged these bosses to behave any way they wanted.

[Race_Strange]: I don't want someone yelling at me. Simple, I am a human being. If
 you can't talk to me like a human, then come back to me when you 
can.
[[deleted]]: i think alot of this trend is because alot og gen z is nihilistic 
and sees no reason to take on extra stress if it won't benefit them 
(cost of living is rising making it unaffordable for a lot of people and
 competition for jobs is getting worse) Plus I think a little bit of it 
is because the parents being shit babying there kids but I think thats 
for the younger side of gen z
[Ordinary_Mortgage870]: Because Gen Z went through a lot of unpredictability and stressors
 - Gen Z is more in tune with their emotions, and had to take on a shift
 in security with 9/11, 2008 crash, school shootings, etc as young 
teens/children... add on the toxic nonsense of social media and our 
parents generational trauma, online bullying, etc. and of course Gen Z 
is more sensitive - and now Gen Z's work is reduced to a pittance while 
prices are rising, while we were also sold on the idea that college was 
the be-all for career and professional advancement - even amassing debt 
to do so - while other generations had more leniency, where they could 
go to college, pay rent, etc. while working something that didn't 
require a degree: basically, our work and time is worth less than 
previous generations. All while being demanded we meet deadlines and 
accept abuses from higher ups due to it being a companies market and not
 an employees market. Tell me you wouldn't be more sensitive after that 
nonsense.
born in 97 here. are we actually more in tune with our feelings? i
 feel like most of us are always overthinking and anxious which is 
litterally as opposite of being present in your emotions as possible. I 
think if anything we are the generation least in tune with our feelings.
 we are never present, always thinking or consuming media. previous 
generations were more in tune with their emotions, they were just taught
 to supress and ignore them. I feel like our generation just dissociates
 and doesnt even really feel the emotion. Im a private music teacher who
 teaches primarily gen Z but also gen alpha and i gotta say idt we even 
feel at all really, we intellectualize our feelings and convince 
ourselves that that is feeling. in reality thats just a coping mechanism
 to not feel. the world we’re in today- if we actually were present and 
felt all the feelings we would just be entirely crushed, so im not 
saying its our fault. the state of the world basically requires you to 
either be truly present and kill yourself or dissociate, overthink, and 
consume media and stay alive…

[EVOSexyBeast]: aka saying she can’t handle a raised voice from her boss
It’s not that i can’t handle it, I won’t handle it. I can easily 
get a different job that does not have a toxic work environment so I 
will push back when it happens and then quit if it happens again.
I think the question you should be asking is why older millennials
 and gen x have piss poor management skills or are push overs for 
managers.
[ephyre]: I think there's a lot of hopelessness. People on social media can 
see how a system or society can fail them and that makes them really 
anxious and less confident. People don't really share when they fuck up 
at work but the boss is ok with it. They don't really share when things 
are unexpectedly good or just ok. Every Internet story/video is extreme 
examples.
I also think the jobs these days just suck. Every job is either 
poverty or high stress and/or barrier to entry. There's not really a 
middle ground like manufacturing was.
[punk_rock_book_worm_]: I think you’re massively overgeneralizing.
[Opposite-Birthday69]: I got screamed at a lot by my gen x parents. Especially for not 
making eye contact (figured that one out a few years ago). They didn’t 
really complement me when I did well at anything, but they were quick to
 point out what I didn’t do or what I should have done better at. My 
parents were also the more typical gen x helicopter parents. I was 
allowed to quit pretty much anything when it got too hard for me. I’ve 
always excelled at anything I tried but it was never enough.
My parents make better friends than parents now that I’m an adult.
They wonder why I spiraled when I failed my first class (college 
math, mind you I’m really good at math), or how I panic when I try and 
set up a date and cancel right before because I panicked too much, or 
why I freak out filling out job after job applications (forms get me), 
and why I rarely leave the house (I play online games, I’m not a 
complete shut in)
I guess this is a long way to say they were overly critical and allowed me to quit before I could fail anything
[mavenwaven]: I think the book The Anxious Generation makes some educated 
guesses towards the trend of being overwelmed by common stressors.
But I also think it's just more socially acceptable for people to 
admit when they don't like something- I don't think we should tolerate 
bosses yelling at staff or speaking disrespectfully to employees, 
personally. All the places I've worked at with a boss willing to do that
 were super toxic, and I think the blame for unprofessionalism should be
 pointed at the instigator, instead of us judging how well the intern 
takes a verbal beating.
[Senior_Ad1737]: When my students felt pressure (university /college) I had to 
explain the difference between “having anxiety” and “being anxious” 
about something. . That seems to normalize the feelings they had . I 
think society feels too comfortable diagnosing themselves  for 
things that are normal feelings

Today at my former school district the seniors of 2025 graduated 
and it made me feel sad knowing we are not the most recent graduates 
anymore.
Honestly I probably peaked in high school as I still think of my 
time during senior year very fondly. And I remember every single moment 
of the day of our high school graduation. But now all of that is just a 
memory that happened one year ago…
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[LB-Bandido]: Man its been only 1 year
I know but I can’t help but remember the glory days of my peak in high school
Bruh it's been only 1 year lololol
That’s a weird way to respond but okay.
Not to pick on you but, Random shower thought of:
People who peaked in high school probably didn’t graduate anywhere near the peak of their class
Like the guys and girls I knew who peaked in high school generally were not top 20% academic material.
OP why not go study a trade or get a degree and push back your peaking?

[Serious_Swan_2371]: I had Covid lockdowns from end of junior year through senior year.
 I don’t really remember late high school that fondly bc of that.
I miss college a little now that it’s over partly because I feel 
like I spent my whole senior year grinding for jobs instead of living it
 up like my friends. But part of me is just so done with that. I don’t 
feel like drinking until 6am anymore in a dark frat house and stumbling 
outside to realize that the sun is already up and I have shit to do.
[Own-Run-9384]: I graduated one year before you(I feel old).
I graduated in 2019 and covid caused a timewarp and now i AM old. 
Weird because i feel the same but the world expects a whole lot more 
from me
You are 24…
Yep and i've watched people die, lived off grid alone, now live 
thousands of miles from my closest family, pay all my bills.
I feel I'm expected to behave even older
I also could’ve graduated in 2023 but I got held back. (In kindergarten)

[Far-Difficulty8854]: Yes I can’t help but miss those days
[PassengerOld8627]: Totally get that. It hits different when you’re no longer the 
graduating class it’s like your chapter officially closed and someone 
else is living what used to be your moment. Feels like time is moving 
without you, and yeah, the nostalgia kicks in hard. But peaking in high 
school? Nah. That was just a really good part of your story not the 
whole thing. You’ve still got way more ahead to make just as meaningful.
[BackyZoo]: Every fresh high school graduate peaked in highschool because it 
just happened lol. You can worry about that when you're pushing 30, you 
are still age restricted out of certain activities of course you haven't
 hit your next peak yet.
You are probably a better person now than you were 5 years ago, so
 there's no reason to assume the same thing won't be true 5 years into 
the future.
[FoxWyrd]: You haven't had a chance to figure out if you peaked in high school.
Believe me, Life gets better with age if you do it right.

22F, didn’t go to college and I’m regretting it lowkey cause I 
have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my life and it’s making me 
suicidal. But I have no goals or ambitions, I do not have a dream job 
because I do not dream of labor.. like call me lazy idgaf but all my 
family members that have 9-5 jobs are fucking miserable, but you need 
money to survive and everything is so fucking expensive. On top of that I
 can’t get insurance unless I work a good job but I can’t get a good job
 without a college degree, but I have no fucking money or idea what I 
would want to study in school. Also while working a dead end 9-5 how do 
you have time for anything else? Like doctors appointments or friends or
 hobbies?? I’m going in spirals thinking about all this shit and I’ve 
been in a constant existential crisis since I was 16, when I talk to 
older generations about this stuff they just say that’s how the world 
works and how does that not make you wanna blow your brains out???
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Phantom_STrikerz]: Thank you for the follow-up, you explained it very well. For 
clarification, positive means I do not become demotivated from the lack 
of inherent meaning. And, I feel motivated to make my life better. The 
distinction is, that the source of the motivation comes only from 
myself. I do not wish to please people, government, religion, or 
anything if I do not think I will get a good life. In my case, a good 
life means spending time with my loved ones and doing things we love 
with a lifestyle we like.
[DanChowdah]: “I don’t know how many years on this earth I left so I’m gonna get real weird with it” Frank Reynolds
[More_Fig_6249]: Absurdism is the disconnect between man’s unconscious desire to 
find meaning in a meaningless universe, which is why it’s considered 
Absurdism. It’s an absurd desire seemingly.
[Zeyode]: I think it's existentialism. Life is meaningless so I have the freedom to give it my own subjective meaning.
[glue_zombie]: Shit man I needed to hear that, thanks for sharing. What you said 
is something I already knew in the back of my head but for some reason 
needed to see it spelled out. Thanks for sharing your story, wishin you 
the best
[Are_You_Illiterate]: “ The sooner you take the time to recognize what you can 
change versus what you can't and then focus on what really matters, the 
sooner things will get better.”
The Enchiridion by Epictetus is a FANTASTIC source for wisdom like this. He outlines exactly where that line can be drawn.
[Lime_Drinks]: if you got family supporting you, milk it until you figure out 
what to do. and when you figure it out, you have to develop the long 
term thinking to achieve that goal. if you need a job, i would recommend
 something low stress. graveyard shift hotel clerk, toll booth 
attendant, etc. you wont get paid much, but you'll avoid the stress of 
really working working.
[SimpleMoonFarmer]: What about being a housewife?
while working a dead end 9-5 how do you have time for anything else? Like doctors appointments or friends or hobbies??
That's the neat part, you don't.
Nobody can afford to be a stay at home spouse these days
Had a gf that didn’t work out bc all she wanted was for me to stay
 at home and caused me to miss so much work and start my new job off 
(albeit she helped me get) in a bad place just because she wanted 
quality time.
I simply think it’s the government splitting families up
Not having kids makes it more possible as well as not living in a super expensive area
Live in Kansas and most people I know only the man works.
My wife is lol
That’s not true. Most of my friends have stay at home spouses. 
Once you have multiple kids, daycare costs will eat up most of the 
second salary.
What do you guys think a 9-5 actually is? The way people like you 
describe it always makes it sound like you're working 24/7/365 with no 
breaks. Sure it's fun to putz around every day for 6 hours, but unless 
you're a trust fund baby that won't ever be the case realistically. In 
my experience, a full time job makes me value my free time much more 
than back when all I had was free time. I also work a good job so I have
 cash to burn outside of my savings, so my friends and I can afford to 
do bigger, better things than what we could do back in HS and college.
That's a terrible idea. You are suggesting she completely 
subordinate her existence to a man economically. That puts one in an 
extremely poor situation if it ever ends (it often ends).
Lol you really think nobody with a 9-5 has friends or hobbies? I 
you have plenty of time after 5 to eat, drink, socialize, have fun. You 
have the entire weekend too. Get a decent job and you'll have PTO as 
well. Some of y'all clearly have zero experience in the workforce.

 get a reality check. Most work is boring, not miserable. Miserable is 
lugging baskets of raw sulfur up a steep hill for 10 hours a day. It's 
not being bored in a cubicle wishing you could just live a life of pure

Worth noting actual commies literally idolize menial labor. Look

do it.
You get maybe 70 years to be alive. That's it.
You spend 5/7ths of your life making sure the nepo babies that own you don't have to work at all.
In the 70 or so years you spend living and working you have paid

[kadargo]: Nope. It has been much scarier in the past. GenX had to live under
 the threat of nuclear armageddon. The Boomers had Vietnam. The Silent 
Generation had the Korean War.  The Greatest Generation fought in WW2. 
Before that was the Great Depression. I could go on. In many ways, 
things are much better. The crime rate is at historic lows. And we have 
made great progress in reducing world poverty.
I’m sorry did nukes go somewhere? I must have missed when Superman
 went around the world and chucked all the nukes into the sun. Oh wait 
that didn’t fucking happen lmao. Also only a tiny fraction of boomers 
went to fight in man so stop that bullshit narrative please.

[cherrytheog]: Girl you’re doing way better than me. I went to college for 
marketing and I haven’t even landed a job at all. I have a degree I’m 
planning on throwing away. Start at a community college for maybe either
 an associates degree or a certificate.
Real talk community college goes hard as fuck.
I went to community college for 2 years to get my associates, 
transferred to a traditional public university for my bachelor’s degree 
where I became a commuting student who drove an hour between home and 
school for a year. Only in my very last year did I actually move to 
breathe in the university experience, and I lived with two friends in a 3
 bedroom 2.5 bathroom townhome with a full kitchen and living room 
space.
Between deals with my parents, and loans, I essentially minimized 
as much debt as I possibly could right from the beginning when I decided
 to go to a cc.
I didn’t have too much luck with the scholarship route, but 
according to everybody on campus that you’ll ever talk to those 
resources most definitely exist. The entirety of COVID happened while I 
was at college / university, so what I did end up getting was some 
relief which I did not have to pay back. It wasn’t much, but at the time
 it made a big difference for me.
I made sure not to use all the money from the loans I took either,
 because I figured out that I could just use the loan to pay back the 
loan… sort of like just giving the money back to my loan servicer right 
away and immediately shaving off a couple thousand off my student debt.
Don’t get me wrong, having student debt of any kind is stressful 
as hell, but there are steps you can take to mitigate how much of a 
financial hit you end up taking. Take enough steps, and you’ll come out 
the other side with an amount of debt that is hopefully actually 
manageable.
I do want to say that taking on a much larger amount of debt isn’t
 necessarily the “wrong” life choice either it just depends. If you have
 concrete plans for the future, if you’re extremely passionate about 
what you want to do, then these are valid reasons to take on an 
increasingly larger amount of debt. There are repayment plans and relief
 resources that will help you in the aftermath of taking a much larger 
student loan that are appropriate with your circumstances.
And as for the commenter I’m actually replying to… I want to point
 out that the online discourse about “useless college degrees” isn’t 
completely accurate. No degree is completely worthless, no matter what 
anybody says, and the people saying this are generally either conceited 
or they’ve taken another path in life like the trades and are looking 
for any opportunity to snub academia.
My dad once told me that a degree is essentially a representation 
of dedication and time investment. When you apply to a position, that 
job is keen to know whether or not you’ll actually do right by them and 
stick around, and showing that you have a degree demonstrates that you 
are persistent and committed to a study where you put in the hours and 
followed through.
For myself, I would say I learned University is not really about 
the degree at all. It’s so cliché, but it really is the journey. Many 
graduates don’t actually end up in careers that are directly related to 
your degree at all, and what you’re actually learning (and what your 
employers are actually looking for) are soft skills that will put you 
above your competition.
Hard skills, the actual ability to do the thing that you’re doing,
 is an expected baseline, so the competition—to my mind—is really about 
honing the soft skills that will actually make you successful in the day
 to day work environment of your chosen career path. Things like 
adaptability, conflict resolution, synthetic thinking, communication 
skills, etc.
Meritocracy is dead, so the ability to work with people and network is actually priceless.
For some people these soft skills come very easily and naturally, 
like it’s part of their innate personality, but for that exact reason 
these skills are more difficult to learn if you don’t have them. Soft 
skills can’t really be taught… at least not directly, and there’s no 
single course for “dependability” or “confidence.” You can improve those
 things a great deal, but you don’t just “learn” them after a semester 
or 3 months of boot camp. It’s in the constant striving to make use of 
those skills that you grasp them effectively and with more finesse. 
Lived experience, and the pursuit of long term goals like a degree teach
 you those things.
One of my best friends started at community college and 
transferred into my school my junior year. It took him 8 years to get 
his degree due to varying circumstances. He is currently the smartest 
and most successful person I know in our age group, had a 6 figure offer
 at a spacecraft subsystems firm waiting for him the day he walked 
across the stage
[Dwain-Champaign]: Real talk community college goes hard as fuck.
I went to community college for 2 years to get my associates, 
transferred to a traditional public university for my bachelor’s degree 
where I became a commuting student who drove an hour between home and 
school for a year. Only in my very last year did I actually move to 
breathe in the university experience, and I lived with two friends in a 3
 bedroom 2.5 bathroom townhome with a full kitchen and living room 
space.
Between deals with my parents, and loans, I essentially minimized 
as much debt as I possibly could right from the beginning when I decided
 to go to a cc.
I didn’t have too much luck with the scholarship route, but 
according to everybody on campus that you’ll ever talk to those 
resources most definitely exist. The entirety of COVID happened while I 
was at college / university, so what I did end up getting was some

[Paint-licker4000]: Nope just you and other doomers
Username tracks.
[Quigonjinn12]: Username tracks.
[RescueSheep]: sorry but youre extremely privileged and live in a bubble. for a big part of the worls, a 9-5 is a dream
ya got 16 hours to do whatever tf you want
8 hours sleep 2 hours commuting ya still got 6 hours?
maybe try living on earth ong this makes me mad cause I work 12+ 
hours and I still find time for hobbies and also working out.
You don’t understand that these things are relative. I may give up
 on the same task as you earlier because I don’t see the reward in it 
when you do. I may get depressed after a breakup and you don’t. I may be
 able to lift more weight than you. People are have different tolerance 
levels for stuff. In her case she couldn’t put up with what you do per 
se. Working 12+ hrs is out of her league. Yes, someone in a third world 
country would kill to be her in their mind but that’s not even true. To 
be her you would have to be her not you in her position and a lot of 
people don’t get that. If you had her path you’d be exactly where she is
 too so let’s consider these things

[shadookat]: Exactly how i’ve been feeling too. Life is fucking hard
[laxnut90]: I think you may be obsessing about making the perfect choice of what to do with your life.
But perfection is the enemy of good enough.
Is there a more lucrative field than your current job that you want to get into?
Focus on that.
Then, if 10 years down the line you no longer like that field, feel free to repeat the process.
[jwed420]: Almost everyone I know who graduated college also feels the same 
way. College isn't the fix. Our economy is fucked and there are millions
 of us that are slowly suffocating.
[UniqueDonut]: Are you me? I also don't really know what to do with my life. Idk 
what kinda job I want, what to go to college for, or anything. All I 
know is I don't wanna work minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life.
[spencer1886]: Congrats, you have just met the consequences of your actions. This
 is not being depressed about the state of the world, this is realizing 
that you've been pissing your time away. It's not too late to apply to 
schools, there were dozens of people in my graduating class who were in 
their late 20s and early 30s, even one who was in his late 40s whose 
wife and children attended our graduation. You're 22, it's not like 
you're old, you've got plenty of time to figure things out and turn it 
around. But that won't happen if the only thing you do is complain on 
the internet, it requires effort on your end too.
Yeah. Having no skills, direction, or ambition does not mean that 
life sucks. This person hasn’t even scratched the surface of life, so 
they certainly don’t have any business opining about the state of the 
world.
[Inner-Lab-123]: Yeah. Having no skills, direction, or ambition does not mean that

[ceoperpet]: I went to university. Took a break due to covid and will likely 
finish my last year part time in Sept and a summer school session im 
2026.
College teaches nothing for most people unless youre in a STEM 
field or something or want to pursue academia. At most you make lifelong
 friends.
Im 25 now and will be 26 soon.
You can still go if you want.
Moreover, whatever happens, know that the state of the world is 
far better than it was a hundred years ago or earlier. There's been 
tablets found from loke 6000BC from ancient Assyria about people 
complaining about the same things as before and how they feel like the 
world is going to end.
Live and enjoy your life, because that's the most you can do when it comes to nearly everyone.
Find a hobby, make some friends, build that project, start that 
business, chase that cute girl/guy at the bar like your life depends on 
it et cetera.
Unless you're a politician or a public servant or business leader 
of some significance, the fate of the world isnt yoir responsibility. Do
 your part and live your life.
I mean...you mention "unless you are in a STEM field" as if that 
is some hard thing to do. Of course you need to get an education or 
training in a VALUABLE field. The days of "I went to college, so 
employers will think I'm smart" were over at least 30 years ago. If your
 degree has an A at the end, you just paid a lot for toilet paper.
The world isn’t better
IT is far better. YOU are just worse. In every day. OBJECTIVELY, 
the quality of life has improved greatly over the last 10 years, 20 
years, 30 years, 40 years, etc.
Some people just need to be miserable.

[JimtheSlug]: Unfortunately due to their being so much choice and so much 
pressure to do something we can become overwhelmed and simply just shut 
down. For me it’s just been trail and error. All the best 😊
[MisterNiblet]: Man this was sad to read…I never graduated college but I didn’t 
let that stop me. Thankfully I’m good at sales and I make good money at 
my 9-5 I was able to find a place that I’m not miserable at too! You 
need to take things one step at a time and start with finding something 
that interests you. Also you don’t HAVE to go to get a degree to get a 
good job, I feel like a lot of the anxiety you get when thinking about 
the future is cause by your out look on certain things.
No one “dreams of labor” that’s just part of growing up and doing 
what you need to do because you need food and shelter. You only get out 
what you put in and if you’re not putting in any effort then you’ll 
achieve nothing. It sounds harsh but it’s true. As far as having time 
goes, part of maturing is learning how to manage your time. Start 
documenting events on your phone calendar, make group chats with the 
friends you want to link up with and plan a day in advance for you all 
to hang out. There are ways to work a job and still enjoy life, I sure 
am!
[Jayeky]: The only thing you can do is turn off social media and really lock in with your life.
[[deleted]]: Yes the older gen is right, keep complaining like that and you 
will stay in that shit hole, Life is hard and it's not gonna change 
unless action taken, I know it's easier said than done but once you 
mange it and reach your goals you will see how beautiful life is.
It is ad and hilarious at the same time that all comments saying "Yup...life is not all fun and games" get downvoted.
There is a reason why the average redditor is over twice as likely to commit suicide.

can go to college. I'm 21 rn and college is still in my life plan, just 
not quite yet. And if you're poor, community College is always an option
 🤷🏻‍♀️
Community college is not just an option...it is a GOOD one. 
Getting an associated degree in a SMART field (one that ends in an 
S...not and A) will take you farther in life than even a MASTER'S degree
 in a field with an A at the end. Unless you want to be a teacher. I 
know people that came out of community college with ZERO debt getting an
 x-ray technician degree. Got a job within a week. And loves it.

[goldensowaward]: Yes, Gen Z'ers...you DO have to do things in life that aren't 
always "fun". It is called being an adult. You are paid based on your 
contributions to society. No one is just going to give you things your 
entire life.
[seattleseahawks2014]: I'm 24 and dropped out. Honestly, I'm doing ok considering 
everything that's happened so far in my life. I don't really care much 
as long as I'm comfortable. Also, before I would tell my boss if I had a
 doctor's appointment, people need a work life balance and that's how I 
was able to do my hobbies (not lately) and I spend time with people on 
the weekend sometimes, etc.
[coreyjohn85]: The world's fundamentals is mostly built on clickbait. There is a 
very high chance you are worried about nothing. Imagine being depressed 
about something that might not be even real.
[The_Gaming_Matt]: It sucks but it’s out of your control, focus on your life & the small changesyoucan bring or else you’ll feel powerless & useless which will only bring you down even more
[olcoil]: In poorer countries u don’t have the luxury of just Not Working 
and pondering this. U would starve. That’s a good motivator. I was there
[nightfalldevil]: Adulting sucks. I plan fun things to get me through the work week.
 I simply work to afford a simple life and to have fun with friends.
[pdoxgamer]: I mean, bc having money and a job is nice. Sending warm vibes your
 way bc I can moderately relate to your sentiments a few years ago.
I decided to get a 9-5 and give it a go. Turns out I love it and 
honestly I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life by a large margin. 
It was completely unexpected, but having a nice routine 5 days a week 
has been wonderful. Then I kinda do whatever on the weekends.
Idk, maybe just give it a try, you may enjoy it more than you expect!
[SheenTheUltraLord]: Nope, buddy just get off this website and your outlook will change. Don’t doom scroll, just live life.
[dappernaut77]: I wish I could give you the secret to happiness sister but the 
truth is i'm in the same boat, no aspirations, no desire for a 9-5 and 
no big hopes for the future. It makes me a little nihilistic sometimes 
in all truthfulness but death won't make things better, it never does. 
All it does is hurt the people who care about you and at least for me 
its a horrible thought to have that my loved ones and those close to me 
would have to go on living without me.
The only real words of wisdom I can give is to roll with the 
punches and find fun and happiness wherever it can be found, Even if its
 for a fleeting moment. Life may not have objective meaning but we have 
the ability to give things value as people.
Even if op doesn't see this I hope that someone here will take this to heart and fight for what brings them meaning.
[No-Spite6559]: Me too bro omg.
At this point imma say fuck it and marry a rich man.
[PrizeCelery4849]: V O T E.
[StellarCracker]: If u ain’t somewhat depressed abt the state of the world your 
either blissfully unaware or just unaware/educated period. What 
motivates me is doing even a small thing to make it better tho idk what 
that is yet
[[deleted]]: Hang in there OP and be gentle with yourself. You are not alone and it will get better.
[ComadoreJackSparrow]: 

[[deleted]]: bro, I was just like you. What worked for me is having a plan to 
get better and commiting into it. Just. Do. It. When you have somewhere 
to look up to you can resist difficulty
[ttv_vegan_chef]: Start your own business around a hobby you like. Generate income and still do what you want
[Hoelab]: Go. To. College. Or hate your life as a peasant.
College isn’t doing much anymore, and it’s increasingly evident. 
So many people with degrees that were supposed to be a thriving market 
are drowning in student debt and working at a shit job because they 
can’t get a job with their degree.

[capital_gainesville]: Your job doesn’t have to be a dream job, just get one that you can
 tolerate. Then look for others you can tolerate that pay a more.
You shouldn’t chase fulfillment. Don’t go down that road because it’s a dark path to doomerism.
[Diegorod1357]: Shoulda gone to collage tbh, lot of people took to this I can make
 it my self business man/woman approach over the last few years and 
truth is that only works for a small subset of people. You’re better off
 going to college for STEM or going fully in on trade work. Either way 
you can’t just sit in self sorrow. No matter what you do time keeps 
moving. You can either roll with it or let it roll over you.
[TinkledQueef]: These are exactly my sentients and I also wasn’t about to do more 
school after doing a whole bunch of school. That was a prison I just 
won’t be going back to and degrees aren’t close to what they used to be 
worth with the current job market hence Kroger’s workers with master’s 
degrees. I’m about to join the military which I dread but it’s my last 
option
Degrees are still plenty good as long as they are the RIGHT ones. 
Good tip...if your major doesn't have a VERY SPECIFIC JOB associated 
with it, you are doing college wrong. Going to school for the fun of 
protesting is a waste of money. Going to college for a degree in a 
science field is not.

[CommanderWar64]: u/urwerstnitemayrgo to therapy first of all. Second of all, what are your hobbies, what 
do your friends do, what do you do after work, on your days off?
[Particular-Winter-91]: Some of these comments are so weird? Nobody is happy with working 
unless they’re making very good money AND enjoy what they’re doing; 
which is not a lot of us. Everything is way to expensive these days so 
living still feels impossible even if you’re working a 9-5 so I 
COMPLETELY understand people with the mindset that they don’t want to 
contribute to this.
Wishing it were better is different from ACTUALLY NOT DOING IT and expecting the world to hand you things your whole life.

[Suspicious_Dealer183]: Says regrets something low key then says it’s making them suicidal…. What
[FiFanI]: The Monday-Friday 9-5 thing does suck, but yeah, we gotta work to 
survive. I think it's time we all embrace and push for the New Standard 
Work Week (NSWW) that's been catching on worldwide (4 days x 8 hours = 
32 hours). A 3 day weekend every weekend would help us workers get back 
some free time for friends, family, and hobbies. But if a desk job isn't
 appealing for you, maybe you should consider a trade like electrician 
or lineman or something. Many trades are in demand now and usually pay a
 lot better than jobs that require college degrees.
[bill0124]: A job is not that bad lol
[Bearycool555]: Yes, but we CAN make change. Be productive about it and volunteer 
for an organization that deals with the topics you care about, if 
everyone just out in like 5 hours a week of any type of activism our 
world would change dramatically, for the better
[dildorepairman4urmom]: The world is fine.  In the early 80s, everyone thought USSR was going to nuke us all.  Then is was ISIS.
It's always something.
Learn to be happy.
[[deleted]]: Lucky for you if you’re hot you won’t have to work.
[vaudevillianvivian]: I didn’t want a 9-5 so I went into nursing. There are jobs out 
there. Lots of people don’t have money and go to college. They take out 
loans. You need to find a passion / drive to give you meaning in this 
world
[[deleted]]: Join the military. This will give you the stepping stones you need
 to advance. Structure, reliable income, free education, purpose.
6 years in and am absolutely thriving and ahead of all of my peers by miles.
[[deleted]]: For perspective, the state of the world has always been “bad”.  
Our grandparents and great grandparents had to send their spouses and 
children off to wars, never knowing each day if they were alive or not. 
  We have too much of everything nowadays and too much choice.  It’s the
 paradox of choice.  Try limit your options each day, life is too 
overwhelming nowadays.  Give yourself one option for mealtimes, one 
option for reading material and try get off the internet.  If you can 
get through that for the next few weeeks, then you can start making 
bigger plans for life.  Start small, because when you can handle small 
things, life rewards you with bigger things because it’s an affirmation 
of your ability. But start small! As small as you can.  Keep it 
consistent. The next big steps will come naturally. You can do this 💖
[zyrkseas97]: I like to remind people that humans were having kids, getting 
married, and trying to figure things out during World War 2, the Great 
Depression, the Fall of Rome, the many many massive imperial wars from 
Alexander the Great to Attila the Hun to Ghengis Khan to the dozens of 
wars of succession in China alone. Humans endured two Ice Ages, the 
Pleistocene where Wooly Mammoths and Short Faced Bears and Saber Toothed
 Tigers were hanging out.
Ultimately, no matter how dire, humans simply toil on doing our 
best. The history of human life in the world has not been a linear scale
 upward, it has been a jagged rise and fall over and over like the teeth
 of a saw. It’s not fun or glamorous or easy, but humans have been doing
 hard things for 100,000 years. We are going to stop just because of the
 newest set of bullshit.

TÍTULO: Are most women in our generation on antidepressants now? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
It seems like most of the women in my social circle are on 
antidepressants and/or antianxiety meds. I can't find recent data on the
 actual percentage for the U.S. though.
There's tons of articles about this study showing that 
prescription rates surged during the pandemic, but it's about the rate 
of change in use, not the total rate of use, and I can't find anything 
about post pandemic numbers.

Antidepressant-Dispensing-to-US-Adolescents-and?
autologincheck=redirected
Interestingly, rates slightly declined for young men but surged for young women.
This worries me a lot. What would you guys estimate the rate is, based on your experience?
Edit: it's not the use of medication itself that is concerning, 
it's that the mental health crisis must be getting more severe if more 
people need medication to deal with it.

[Opposite-Birthday69]: Doctors try to prescribe them like candy. Like you complain of a 
little bit of normal anxiety and stress and you’ll get prescribed by a 
GP. I had such an adverse reaction I was told to never go on them again 
unless I was tested for every disorder that adversely reacts to SSRIs
For my depressive symptoms: I was prescribed two SSRIs which did 
very little except make my ADHD worse, then an SNRI despite being prone 
to psychosis. It was not a good time. It took 2 years to fully recover 
from that experience.
All I needed was to start taking vitamin D because I had a severe deficiency.
My doctor assumes I have ADHD based off of my side effects. The 
medication also gave me severe anxiety. The more my dose was upped the 
worse it got. Maybe that’s also because I wasn’t eating on the SSRI. I 
had no hunger or appetite
If every American went to a psychiatrist, I bet almost all of them
 would be prescribed SSRIs. Like, it would be impressive not to get 
prescribed them at this point.
😆 yeah you’re probably right
Pharmaceutical industrial complex makes a lot of money so they have an incentive to give people pills.

They didn’t even diagnose me. I was just given them without 
knowing what the side effects were. Considering I had an adverse 
reaction it was quite dangerous that I didn’t know that my symptoms 
weren’t normal. Not that I really cared because of the high dose I was 
given. Like gaining weight is a normal symptom but I wasn’t eating 
pretty much at all to the point where the nurse that weighed me wanted 
me off of it immediately. I was on it for about 3 or 4 weeks and was 
completely fine going cold turkey because the side effects I got were 
worse than the withdrawal
That's because people don't want to do the most simple thing that 
can alleviate depression; get offline and go outside and get some 
exercise.

No kidding. I know so many people on these meds who spend all day 
on their computers. I had depressive symptoms too. You know what got rid
 of them? Regular exercise and leaving my shitty job. Also eating more 
vegetables
Like this won’t work for literally everybody, but all anyone wants is a friggen pill nowadays
I don't know what kind of doctors people are going to. Mine are 
always reluctant to prescribe anything that isn't absolutely necessary, 
and are suggesting all kinds of exercises, counseling, and minor 
supplements first. (By supplements, I mean "take some magnesium" not 
"check out this specific brand of supplement that is giving me money to 
suggest them.")
It’s a bit more common for doctors to overprescribe SSRIs to women
 but there are a growing number of doctors that are trying a non 
chemical approach such as telling their patients to go outside more
I had a provider prescribe me antidepressants at 10 years old. I 
didn’t take them but just the fact they’d prescribe them pre puberty is 
kinda wild
They don’t do enough to see if they’re really needed
similar situation here, i’ve been prescribed antipsychotics as young as age 11 if i remember correctly
i started escitalopram (lexapro) back in august after having 
severe depression and anxiety basically since childhood. i had to switch
 doctors to get treated for it. my old doctor was very against 
prescribing meds for mental health conditions, and spent like 4 years 
trying to pressure me to go off my ADHD meds that i literally need in 
order to function. whenever i’d tell him about my anxiety and depression
 he’d ask me about my diet, tell me to change virtually everything about
 it, STRONGLY urge me to do keto, suggest that i lose weight (im 
recovering anorexic and he knew this) and every time without fail he 
would recommend i lower my dose of vyvanse. it got to a point where i 
felt like i was getting nowhere with him, because my mental health was 
the thing preventing me from taking better care of my body. so i 
switched to a different doctor and she did a mental health eval and 
prescribed me my meds within like 2 appointments. it’s honestly 
drastically improved my life because im able to just do more things.
i know a lot of doctors are very quick to prescribe 
antidepressants, especially to women, and a lot of the time it seems 
like they don’t make an effort to figure out what wouldactuallybe best for my patients. and honestly, maybe my new doctorwasa bit quick to put me on antidepressants. but in my case, it ended up 
being exactly what i needed, and it makes sense because i specifically 
brought up my mental health to her on our first appointment and made 
that a priority. she asked if i would be okay with taking meds for it 
and i said give it to me NOW.
ultimately i just wish doctors would make more of an effort to 
understand the individual patient’s needs before deciding on a course of
 treatment that could significantly disrupt their life. my new doctor is
 great and very easy to talk to, and i can tell she wants the best for 
her patients, which is really important.
It’s the new opioid.

[kiwi_cannon_]: We (America) are trying to medicate our way out of dystopia and 
it's not going to work. Trust me, they'd be dumping antidepressants on 
men like candy too if it wasn't for the fact that men are less likely to
 be upfront about being unhappy due to the societal stigma around men 
being open about their feelings.
^ this...
You don't even need to be open about emotions as a man. I had 
heart issues and when describing what happened to the doctor he just 
said it was a panic attack and prescribed me Antidepressants and 
antianxiety pills.
I took neither, kept pressing to go to a cardiologist, and look at
 that I actually had heart issues going on. Some docs are good and take 
things seriously, others are quacks that just want to medicate the 
problems away.
The US government would rather everyone in the country take SSRIs 
than work towards giving us a functional social safety net, 
environmental protections, better public transportation, affordable 
housing, and labor rights.
I mean men also commit suicide at a significantly higher rate. Maybe those antidepressants could have helped

I don't know, I'm not well read on the matter. However, anti

I know its hoodooo voodoo to some, but really just eating better,

getting more sun, connecting with something spiritually, and working out
 or just moving would solve a lot of issues for a lot of people.
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder since I was 8 years old.

A lot of people need antidepressants to start doing these things. 
But our current lifestyle doesn’t give most people the opportunity (time
 and money) to make and eat good food, get quality exercise, or forge 
and maintain the social relationships to keep people happy/healthy.
I love how literally being alive and taking care of your health is
 considered hoodooo voodoo but just shotgunning pills at it is 
considered the right way
i also had anti depressants temporarily, for a couple years.
interestingly enough i was actually refused therapy when i was at 
my worst because there were concerns that talking about all the bad 
stuff would lead me to attempting suicide immediately after. my doctors 
wanted my mental health to be a OK enough that i could engage in therapy
 and cope with it long enough to see the benefits.
for me, anti depressants barely touched my depression, but once i 
was at a point that i was mentally ok enough to just about start doing 
the basic stuff like showering, leaving my house, eating healthy more 
consistently, etc, i was finally able to come off anti depressants
unless there’s a permanent chemical issue in the brain, it should be temporary for sure
People need betterlives. Our current lifestyle is depressing, so of course people living it are depressed.
If we had a 16-20 hour work week, 6-8 weeks paid vacation, 
accessible higher education, fair and affordable housing, subsidized 
childcare, and more parks/greenspace/third spaces people would be 
happier and less depressed. And we could easily have had those things if
 workers wages had increased as productivity did over the last 7 
decades.
Even with more free time I feel like a majority of people would 
still just rot on their couch doomscrolling all day long. It is 10000% 
bullshit that we have computers doing things more efficiently than any 
time in history and we’re still working 40 hrs as if every one that has 
an office job isn’t slacking at least 2 hrs a day.
Increased leisure time would also aid in curbing depression.
But then how could Elon pay for his spaceship??? You're so 
selfish, wanting the money to go for everyone instead of the 1%. ;)
It's a systemic issue. Society is great at prescribing but doesn't
 give much thought to preventing. Why are people becoming increasingly 
anxious in the first place?
Fixing life circumstances is the biggest cure to depression.  1 in
 14 young woman take anti depressants, that's crazy.  The reason so many
 people are depressed is because they have reason to be, they are 
unhealthy, have no hobbies, and do nothing all day.
Honestly, and after years of experimenting, and receiving a 
bachelor’s in psychology, hallucinogenic mushrooms. I have never 
experienced better and faster results on any other substance, prescribed
 or otherwise
Do you think that, if themajorityof people require 
anti-anxiety or anti-depressants (i.e. a chemical alteration to brain 
processes in order to "function appropriately") that it's not actually a
 medical issue but a combination of social dysfunction and improper 
medical perspective?

[PoweredByMeanBean]: It's concerning because it indicates that more people are having 
mental health issues severe enough to require medication. The medication
 isn't the issue, it's just an indicator for declining mental health.
I think you're missing the fact that antidepressants are 
increasingly prescribed for conditions that are not related to mental 
health. Different SSRIs and tricyclics have been discovered to be 
effective treatment for gastrointestinal disorders, pelvic pain 
disorders, = idiopathic itching... and a bunch of other things that 
women suffer from more than men. It's true that these are serious drugs 
that can be hell to come off of. But for some of my female family 
members that have had these problems, they have been really life 
restoring.

No.

That seems unrelated, as industrialized societies have lower birth
 rates. A tribal woman in Zimbabwe isn't likely to be on 
antidepressants. She is also more likely to have 7 kids.
The question is: Is having a mentally ill mother better than society having one more childless woman?
The problem is that a lot of those women don’t have a severe mental illness, doctors prescribe SSRI way too much nowadays.
They prescribed me one when I was 17 because I was struggling with
 a difficult situation at home and sleep deprivation. All I needed was 
to be removed from that situation and to have better life habits, but 
their solution was to prescribe me a ton of drugs that actually ended up
 making it significantly worse.

started eating/sleeping well. One year later life was good and it just 
kept getting better from there. If I had listened to the doctors I 
should’ve taken those pills all my life and tried to cope.
Since Covid the prescription of antidepressants on teenagers and young adults has increased significantly, that’s bad.
[Juggernaut111]: That seems unrelated, as industrialized societies have lower birth
 rates. A tribal woman in Zimbabwe isn't likely to be on 
antidepressants. She is also more likely to have 7 kids.
[Rainbowdark96]: The question is: Is having a mentally ill mother better than society having one more childless woman?
The problem is that a lot of those women don’t have a severe mental illness, doctors prescribe SSRI way too much nowadays.
They prescribed me one when I was 17 because I was struggling with
 a difficult situation at home and sleep deprivation. All I needed was 
to be removed from that situation and to have better life habits, but 
their solution was to prescribe me a ton of drugs that actually ended up
 making it significantly worse.

What is the altervative then? İgnoring them altogether?
Fixing the root cause, which will vary by individual. Idk why 
people here can't grasp that depression and anxiety can be caused by 
some underlying issue. Which doesn't mean you shouldn't take SSRIs to 
alleviate the symptoms, that's like saying you shouldn't use a bandage 
because getting cut is what actually hurt you. But if there's a huge 
surge in the number of people needing bandages, maybe we should figure 
out what is cutting them?
It's interesting how therapy has become more common and socially 
acceptable, to the point where therapy is recommended for everything and
 people who don't seek therapy are ridiculed.  Yet suicide and 
depression rates only continue to increase every year.

[cheoliesangels]: When women have mental/physical health issues, they’re much more 
likely to reach out to get them addressed than wallowing. It’s also 
probably why they complain on the internet less than men of this 
generation do.
Then why do Asian women in the US use anti-depressants at a rate 
1/7th of white women with better results? Are they just wallowing? Or 
are they addressing root causes of their problems instead of adapting 
their brain chemistry?
Cultural reasons. Many first-gen cultures, particularly of Asian 
and African countries, don’t even believe mental health illnesses are 
real/serious. I come from one of them. There is an emphasis on suffering
 in silence to protect image. That includes, also, not complaining on 
the internet all the time even when things are difficult.

Yeah, having grown up in a huge Mexican-American family that 
didn't believe mental illness was real until very recently, I can 
confirm. When people don't believe in therapy, the alternative is often 
turning to alcohol/drugs to get through the day. Before therapy existed,
 alcoholism was basically just... absolutely everywhere, all the time.
In my culture, it's not uncommon for at least one parent to 1) 
have a martyr complex, 2) make it everyone else's problem when they're 
angry or miserable, 3) mock the kids for crying or being upset. Just 
because people aren't being treated for mental illness doesn't mean 
they're mentally healthy.
i am an asian woman!!!!
asians are hardasses about mental health. i had to attempt suicide
 for my parents to listen n let me go to therapy 🤭 and then i had to 
push them for meds (took me 3 years) when they finally relented they 
were like SHIT if we knew she would've improved like this we would have 
done it sooner (i love my papa y me mama)
that's the thing though, i am an outlier. plenty of people don't 
attempt suicide but i know other asian kids have fell into self 
destructive behaviors because they couldn't get treatment.
it's sad because they think ignoring it is the best for their kid 
when what the best is to let them get the help they need.

My sister is an elder millennial. When she finally went to a

[Side__CHARActer]: A problem I noted is that a lot of women are on antidepressants 
but my thyroid doctor made an interesting comment that there has been a 
rise is thyroid (personal experience) and other hormone 
diseases/problems (think anything from that effects a woman’s 
progesterone or estrogen levels - yes even hormonal birth control) that 
have depression as a side effect and the quick fix of antidepressants is
 preventing these other problems from being addressed.
I also am inclined to believed that the lack of healthy eating and
 active lifestyle is also increasing depression and other mood 
disorders.
i wonder how long its going to take them to look into this more. 
the inclusion of plastics and shit we ingest and have in our bodies has 
to take a toll on shit in utero.  i have to wonder if thats contributed 
also to the rise in neurodivergence too

[SnooOwls6136]: Stress and anxiety is very natural, especially for people at 
dynamic ages with lots of important life events, like teenagers, 20 
somethings, etc
What isn’t natural is that US doctors have financial incentives to
 prescribe drugs to people and they do so at alarming rates. Think of 
all the children on scribes because their parents went to the doctor to 
discuss behaviors that are natural to children. I knew kids, especially 
wealthier, who were on Xanax growing up because their parents complained
 they had too much energy. Insanity
[sleetblue]: Anti depressant over-prescription is a symptom of larger issues 
going on in American society as a result of the worsening conditions 
under capitalism.
People feel more hopeless and more powerless, and because 
anti-depressants aren't narcotic, it's easy to use the prescription of 
them to pad the profit margins of pharmaceutical companies.
The US owns something like 40% of the global antidepressantmarket share, which is a multi-billion dollar industry.
There's no official incentive to address the issues which lead 
people to hopeless depression, such as crushing poverty, lack of access 
to education or healthcare, crumbling infrastructure, increasing levels 
of social isolation, etc., but there IS a private profit incentive to 
take advantage of the situation.
[[deleted]]: The wild part is that there’s actually no evidence that SSRIs help
 with depression and no evidence for the serotonin theory of depression.
 They’re also nightmarish to come off of by all accounts, even with 
tapering. And if you weren’t already feeling numb and anhedonic, SSRIs 
will make sure that you do.
They also cause sexual dysfunction. Which I’m sure is a factor in why Gen Z is so prudish and sexless.
Every few years an article like this comes out showing they aren’t
 any better than placebo, and it gets buried by the drug industry.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4592645/
For mild to moderate depression my advice would be to do cognitive
 behavioral therapy. For severe depression look into ketamine therapy. 
Stay away from SSRIs, which many physicians give out like candy.
I want to point out that your article attributes the lack of effectiveness to mild and moderate cases. Thatdoesmake an argument against overprescribing, but SSRIs definitively do help with severe depression.
I remember some doctors on YouTube going over the last big 
SSRI/serotonin theory thing and their explanation was pretty reliably 
that even with the seratonin theory being wrong, the meds to seem to 
help a lot of people, so we dont understand fully what they're doing.

[Clementinequeen95]: Yes all of us. It is mandated that every single woman must be on antidepressants
Thanks for the valuable contribution to the conversation.
[DuelJ]: Thanks for the valuable contribution to the conversation.
[anothermeee23]: I want to go on them but my husband doesn’t want me to be 
emotionally vacant. I opened up to my friend/colleague the other day and
 she said she got on one 6 months ago because the stress in our new job 
(new graduate nurses) was eating her up. She also said half the nurses 
are on it. She does describe it sometimes as feeling on autopilot and 
like a zombie, so guess my husband is sorta right.
[YoSettleDownMan]: I have been offered anxiety medication and antidepressants during a
 yearly physical. I had not given any indication at all that I was 
experiencing these problems. The doctor just offered to write the 
scripts.
My son had an altercation at school. Was not his fault and not a 
huge deal, but the guidance councilor said we should have him talk to 
someone if he wanted. After one session, it was clear they were ready to
 diagnose him with any ailment we saw fit as long as we got the payment 
plan set up.
People need to realize that these are businesses. They are there 
to make money. They are not your friends, and they don't always have 
your best interests at heart.
[Middle-Fill-445]: Anecdotally, i think it's because doctors are far more likely to 
believe that a woman has mental problems than physical problems. Almost 
every woman I know has had a doctor dismiss her real physical issue for 
anxiety or depression.
Women also are not studied anywhere near the level that men are, 
so I'm sure many symptoms that appear as anxiety and depression are 
actually caused by a physical issue somewhere in the body, and there 
simply hasn't been enough scientific research into the female body to 
understand the connection. So, we get treated with psych meds as a 
bandaid for the real problem.
I've been on a whole host of psych meds and have had some pretty 
strong diagnosis, I eventually lost my healthcare but also my living 
situation has improved, so mentally I am doing the best I've ever been 
without meds but lo and behold, my original physical problems are still 
present as ever.
[Yellow-Mike]: Majority? No. A significant portion? Yes. Something we should do 
something about? Goddamn yes. But keep in mind nobody's ecstatic to have
 to take SSRIs and it's still better to have medicated people than have 
them take a turn for the worse.
[[deleted]]: People like to crap on the boomers and their way of life but they 
weren’t suppressing their emotions and offing themselves in record 
number.
[HannyBo9]: It’s crazy how many are nowadays. No pun intended.
[Sharp_Style_8500]: My mother, wife, sister in-law, niece, most of my wife’s friends, 
most of my female friends from childhood are on depression/anxiety meds.
 Most of my female co workers talk openly about their prescribed 
depression/anxiety meds. There is an issue somewhere.

--- DOCUMENTO: Are we going to see a huge spike in suicides with Gen Z as they reach middle age_ _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: Are we going to see a huge spike in suicides with Gen Z as they reach middle age? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Here is a question I’ve pondered lately: are we going to see a 
huge influx of suicides as AI and late stage capitalism destroys people?
I could see a huge spike with Gen Z specifically as they turn 
middle age and have no significant career, home, savings or partner. As 
you get older social connections just fall off additionally our parents 
will pass.
How does one operate mentally for years and years without being 
able to hit various life milestones? At some point the long-term 
depression will take root.
The future looks bleak for Americans and it seems like it will only get worse.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[ApartmentWorried5692]: The least depressing post on this sub.
Sadly its not the most lunatic one
Op sadly seems to be very likely
[TheGalator]: Sadly its not the most lunatic one

[abrandis]: Idk that was  very different time , the world valued your labor, 
today modern economy and business is all about automating away the need 
for people or at least the more expensive skilled people, they'll still 
gladly hire migrant labor at slave wages.
It’s been like that for decades though. 80s was all about 
offshoring labor to Asia. 90s had NAFTA. People have been dealing with 
this stuff for a while.
If you just read about how the world economy has changed over the 
decades it should be obvious these problems have been constant.
Lots of people in tech got laid off in the early 90s and people trained their replacements in Thailand, China, etc.

[Yarus43]: While I would agree I think there is a certain point where things 
have gotten so bad you cant just say "well other times sucked so this is
 the norm".
I used to be able to be really positive but the job market is 
fucked, I've been searching for months and have gotten desperate enough 
to start doing gig jobs, cutting and moving fire wood for a neighbor, 
building fences, cleaning houses, anything just to get by. And I'm 
barely surviving by the skin of my teeth. Now with food stamps being cut
 I'm gonna be lucky if I can afford a loaf bread. I already can't afford
 to fix my water so now I'm stuck to gathering water from a river and 
boiling it
[avrg-enjoyer]: Survivorship bias imo
[ic4rys2]: Every generation before us (except maybe millennials) has been set up to be wealthier than their parents
[TheGalator]: And every generation the suicide goes up so I really don't see your point mate
[ItzMattOnTheTrack]: News flash: everyone still thinks shit is fucked when they’re 
older, they’re just so beaten down they don’t fight it anymore
It doesn’t mean the system is working or that’s it’s in good shape.
Edit: I would also like to add that statistically across the board
 we are worse off now than during the great depression, we have actual 
data to back this up.
[LowInteraction9422]: No, the suicide rate was very low in 2000. It's been increasing 
ever since. The suicide rate is now the highest its been since World War
 II.
[[deleted]]: The problems of today have reached an impass because every 
previous generation just kicked the can down the road while creating 
additional problems on top of it.
Like the last issue society genuinely solved was banning the 
chemicals that created a hole in the ozone layer, and that was like 20 
years ago...
Job growth outside of the AI bubble is at 0%, we've gone oonga 
boonga on climate change, every continent on the planet has looming or 
active wars on the horizon...
Shit is fucked indeed.
We're facing imminent population collapse where most of us will 
not make it. For the ones who manage to reproduce, their children's 
future is even bleaker than ours. I think in today's world it's healthy 
to be in a state of grief, despair even.
[Budget_Career_7156]: You didn’t mention 50.
…gulp!
[2quick96]: Meh with the way I eat and do things. I will not be seeing 30. My end won’t be taking myself out by suicide at least.
I'm 27 and fully expect to have a heart attack or stroke by the 
time I'm 30. I eat like garbage, my blood pressure is practically a 
power washer, I definitely don't get enough exercise, and my anxiety is 
so bad I can barely function some days and I couldn't get a good night's
 sleep if I tried (which results in drinking a ton of coffee and energy 
drinks, no doubt making everything worse). And I'm lonely af, no SO or 
friends or anything, just the judgiest cat in the world.
What’s stopping you from making small but gradual health 
improvements? Food and exercise you can control and sleep is worth 
trying to find remedies for.
You’ve probably been asked this and you aren’t the first I’ve seen
 have this exact same mindset. Do you believe you’re not worth putting 
effort into or do you enjoy this way of life? Genuinely curious.
How much time do you have?
I really don't enjoy living this way. Maybe there's some 
undiagnosed depression  or extreme burnout or something at play, because
 my motivation has been in the negative for a while. I really do want to
 improve, I know this isn't a healthy way of life, but I struggle with 
even getting started. I hate to say I've given up, but... I think I've 
given up.
I work a full time retail job I hate that doesn't even pay enough 
to move out of my dad's place. At the same time, though, the job market 
is totally borked right now, I landed this job right as Covid was 
ramping up and it's been stable. Even my boss is trying to motivate me 
to find something better. I get home in the evening and don't want to do
 anything, so instead I stare at Reddit until some ungodly time of 
night. My weekend (actually in the middle of the week) comes around and I
 make it from the bed to the couch, and that's about it. I don't have 
the energy after work to exercise. I don't have the energy after work to
 cook real food, just grab a burrito on the way home or throw a pizza in
 the oven (after McDonalds or Taco Bell for lunch, of course). Can't 
even build up the energy to play some video games, something I used to 
love dearly, something I used to cancel commitments for.
I'm constantly haunted by the feeling that I should have 
accomplished more by now. Procrastination, and not giving a shit when it
 mattered, bit me in the ass, and now I feel stuck. I graduated high 
school 9 years ago and haven't done a damn thing productive since. I 
live with my dad and two siblings (and two cats), but I feel alone. I do
 get the occasional hounding from my dad, and all I can say is, "I 
know." The only thing I got going for me right now is that I'm saving a 
shitton of money.
I need that kick in the ass. And I need it now.
TL;DR: Lack of motivation to do anything. I'm so burnt out I don't want to do anything.
Is it really easier to live this life where you suffer or would it be easier to try and make some change?
Forget the other 27 year olds, every journey has to start 
somewhere small and realize the only one who give that kick in the ass 
is you. Go for a five minute walk, put money away for training or eat 
fast food less. Hell, go smaller if you need to, just something you can 
measure and scale. Learn to be kinder to yourself too, that’s a skill 
that has helped me personally.
You forget that people restart their lives all the time and at any
 age. There’s people out there who have lost their job or realized 
everything they worked for made them miserable and just have to start 
from 0. So don’t worry about what you haven’t accomplished, focus on the
 activities within your control that will get you to the place you want 
to be.
Surely that has to be easier than rotting away, no?
Nothing to offer you bat “Same”, brother.
Unemployed tho with no money so the shame is heavier.
Hope things get better for you.
Those are all your life choices.
No shit Sherlock.
Suicide via chicken fried steak? That’s an idea I can get behind!

[Castello_01]: What’s stopping you from making small but gradual health 
improvements? Food and exercise you can control and sleep is worth 
trying to find remedies for.
You’ve probably been asked this and you aren’t the first I’ve seen
 have this exact same mindset. Do you believe you’re not worth putting 
effort into or do you enjoy this way of life? Genuinely curious.
How much time do you have?
I really don't enjoy living this way. Maybe there's some 
undiagnosed depression  or extreme burnout or something at play, because
 my motivation has been in the negative for a while. I really do want to
 improve, I know this isn't a healthy way of life, but I struggle with 
even getting started. I hate to say I've given up, but... I think I've 
given up.
I work a full time retail job I hate that doesn't even pay enough 
to move out of my dad's place. At the same time, though, the job market 
is totally borked right now, I landed this job right as Covid was 
ramping up and it's been stable. Even my boss is trying to motivate me 
to find something better. I get home in the evening and don't want to do
 anything, so instead I stare at Reddit until some ungodly time of 
night. My weekend (actually in the middle of the week) comes around and I
 make it from the bed to the couch, and that's about it. I don't have 
the energy after work to exercise. I don't have the energy after work to
 cook real food, just grab a burrito on the way home or throw a pizza in
 the oven (after McDonalds or Taco Bell for lunch, of course). Can't 
even build up the energy to play some video games, something I used to 
love dearly, something I used to cancel commitments for.
I'm constantly haunted by the feeling that I should have 
accomplished more by now. Procrastination, and not giving a shit when it
 mattered, bit me in the ass, and now I feel stuck. I graduated high 
school 9 years ago and haven't done a damn thing productive since. I 
live with my dad and two siblings (and two cats), but I feel alone. I do
 get the occasional hounding from my dad, and all I can say is, "I 
know." The only thing I got going for me right now is that I'm saving a 
shitton of money.
I need that kick in the ass. And I need it now.

[Adventurous_Ad7442]: Those are all your life choices.
No shit Sherlock.
[RenewedPotential]: No shit Sherlock.
[Sweet_Shirt]: Suicide via chicken fried steak? That’s an idea I can get behind!
[polly-penguin]: It kinda takes effort to actively commit suicide. Most Gen Zs I 
know, including myself, are depressed and cynical, some even to the 
point of being suicidal, but most of it manifests as passive, do-nothing
 behavior like bed rotting or just drowning out everything bad by 
burying your consciousness with media consumption. So no - I think there
 will continue to be many suicidal people in our generation, but I don't
 think they'll actually be committing suicide.
[Saturn_Coffee]: Absolutely. Job market's fucked, can't get a house, can't get a 
car. Life is already miserable. Only thing keeping me here is fear of 
disappointing my friends by turning in early.
[No_Vegetable_6645]: "I weep for the future of our kind"- Amy Rose (Sonic Boom)
She went to four years of masters school
Yep....and I'm afraid that quote from Sonic Boom is accurate especially in these times.
I was quoting when she said "I did not go to four years of masters
 school to be called a dusty bitch," to which Sonic replied "Well what 
did you go for then?, 'cause I can't tell."
Ohhhh okay, valid tho.

[No_Vegetable_6645]: Ohhhh okay, valid tho.
[Gullible-Ad-426]: If things continue the way they are going for a lot of us right 
now (particularly for a lot of men), I do think that’s going to be the 
case. If people have no family, no partner, no house, few to no friends,
 pretty much only work for 40+ hours a week then come home to a shitty 
apartment, and know they will never be able to save enough to retire, a 
lot of people in that situation (though not all, some people genuinely 
are fine with solitude) are going to be very depressed and will question
 why they should keep at it for another 20-30 years.
[0o0o0o0o0oo0o]: One thing is for sure, people die. Sometimes they do it, other 
times not. Randomly, people are alive then the next moment they aren't 
anymore. People alive, then they ain't. Can't explain that.
[Professional_Bank50]: I don’t think so. Mainly because you have a different set of 
requirements than what you had at age 20. If middle age was combined 
with drugs or alcohol maybe. But Gen Z doesn’t seem to be interested in 
drugs and alcohol like previous generations.
[Joshmoooze]: What do you think about your situation?
[Yarus43]: Idk but I'll probably blow my brains out if I can't get a job soon. I'd like to have running water and clean clothes again
[PaleSupport17]: People forget that when Gen Z turns middle age, most Boomers won't
 be around anymore, which will probably change things massively.
True. Boomers passing away might mean some real progression
[Cat-guy64]: True. Boomers passing away might mean some real progression
[Material_Ad_2970]: You have to make a number of assumptions to get to this point:
AI continues as we expect it to
Capitalism continues as we expect it to
Gen Z’s psychology stays the same as they get older.
Might we see mass suicides in a few decades? Maybe, but older 
people are generally happier than younger people, even accounting for 
wealth. I wouldn’t expect to see awaveof suicides—but a larger number of gen Z suicides then generations before them at that same age wouldn’t be unexpected.
[One-Duck-5627]: No. AI is a communication revolution, it’s creating a bubble, which will pop (like the .com bubble).
We’re much more likely to die fromwar, civil-unrest, orfaminebefore we reach middle-age.
[Disastrous-Dress521]: I mean, suicide rates are going up, probably aint gonna see a 
spike though unless we've got ourselves a great depression era sonethin
[ChoasSeed]: I think it could go either way, just depends how things go
Politically speaking, the next 8-12 years will be critical. It could easily set the stage for the next several decades.
[[deleted]]: Politically speaking, the next 8-12 years will be critical. It could easily set the stage for the next several decades.
[jamesishere]: If you are a terminally online redditor with no friends, family, 
spiritual foundation, and immense fear of ever working a normal blue 
collar job, then I can see why you think suicide is reasonable. But this
 site is full of lunatics
What other jobs even exist
You can always find a job as a PCA or a DSP working with old and disabled people.
[-NGC-6302-]: What other jobs even exist

[SlavaAmericana]: You can always find a job as a PCA or a DSP working with old and disabled people.
[campingInAnRV]: i think we will do a lot better than anyone expects us to do (including ourselves).
a lot of what i see on this sub is the same stuff but i feel it isnt representative of our generation as a whole
[geoffyeos]: i think the remainder of this decade will determine that. i’ll be 
30 in 2031. gotta see how USA speedrunning imperial collapse pans out 
first
[slowboater]: We already are, starting with your elderly generational neighbors (millenial here)
[SlavaAmericana]: There is a huge spike for unmarried middle aged men in general, so
 with the marriage rates in gen z (and millennials) I would assume that 
suicide rates will be higher even if rate of unmarried middle aged men 
committing suicide stays stable.
[Born-Ad2552]: I think it's more likely that there will be a war that ends us all. Maybe a civil war or class based war.
[No-Palpitation-2047]: yes it will be alarming how many people’s retirement plan is eating a bullet
[Gheezer1234]: I think men will group up and do something drastic in revenge for 
being neglected for 30 so years before it gets to that point. The world 
relies on them and yet they are the demographic doing the worst in every
 category. No allies in their own leaders or opposite gender of the same
 age. It will honestly be like a rubber band contracting.
[shironipepperoni]: From personal experience I think, yes. I would love to be wrong 
and proven wrong, but I already struggle so much (25F). I genuinely do 
not believe my child will have a better life than me.
My partner and I make more money than my parents did at our age. 
It took my parents (Gen Xers) until their 40s to make the kind of money 
he and I do now and it's still not enough. My mom was on her second home
 as a single mom without a college degree by 26 and I will be lucky to 
try to get a home at 36. I constantly fear if I do have kids, aside from
 climate, economic, and political issues, just the absolute bleak state 
of a life without dignity for working class people will cause my child 
to resent me for bringing them into this failing world and society.
If I manage to get a house and have kids in my 30s and in my 
middle or old age my child tells me they wish they were never born to be
 spared the struggle and steep uphill climb it will gut me. I really 
hope to be proven wrong but I genuinely have no optimism for the future 
and my dreams seem unachievable. Hard work does not pay off in my decade
 of working so far, it just leads to burnout.
[thrwy11116]: Probz
[fortheculture303]: Or political revolution that leads to death idk
Not to sound like a propagandist, but at least that way you're dying for something.
[PartyDanimal]: Not to sound like a propagandist, but at least that way you're dying for something.
[Professional_Gate677]: Late stage capitalism or early stage socialism??
[ContentWhile]: Wouldnt be surprised if it happens earlier then middle age
I live in Sweden where even when times where better you often got 
your first real job through contacts in the family and networks.
I graduated in June, got one job where the boss quickly fired me due to "misrecruiting" and...yeah,
The social systems that rest of the world thinks we have have been
 torn down and really mismanaged for decades, and i wouldnt even be 
surprised if i dont even survive untill 30
[Happy-Viper]: I really think people need to work on their gratitude nowadays in a big way.
Everyone’s complaining about what they don’t have instead of appreciating what they do.
[dizzy_hafaadai]: Warning yall now. Maturity might literally mean surviving suicide.
 Google when the brain fully develops. Yall think you’re thinking, just 
wait hehe. I’m 27. May the force be with you.
[86baseTC]: Young folks are already killing themselves more
[BrummbarKT]: Idk, a lot of older folks say they are happier than they were in 
their 20s because they have settled into their identity, don't feel as 
overwhelmed by their situation, anxieties have mellowed out. So 
hopefully I will get there some day, though I do wonder if we have the 
same potential given the state of things. I do know one thing, I'm 
already tired of life at 25 and currently if I were to lose my parents I
 have nothing left stopping me.
[blightsteel101]: I dont think it'll just be Gen Z. Im as anti-AI hype as it gets, 
but I'm not going to claim we aren't going to see a massive shift in 
tons of industries because of it. Our governments, as they stand, are 
not prepared for the paradigm shift AI will bring, nor are they ready 
for the number of hungry mouths that will crop up.
Hell, at least in the US, we get scared even saying the words that we're going to need (socialism).
The alternative is a lot of angry, desperate people with nothing to lose.
[bruh_itspoopyscoop]: No. I cannot possibly stress to you enough that humans have been through WAY worse times and have come out alright.
Humanity will be fine, but the suicide rate for unmarried middle 
age men is higher than average. Looking at marriage rates, it isnt 
unlikely that suicide rates will be higher among gen z and 
millennials.
[SlavaAmericana]: Humanity will be fine, but the suicide rate for unmarried middle

[Elbeske]: You may be projecting a lil bit there bud
[JustACanadianGamer]: Jeez, I hope not
[[deleted]]: Lol middle age is a little optimistic.
[This-Phase-1049]: bro what
[lavafish80]: I turned to God to help me with my problems. I know it doesn't 
help everyone but I pray it can help as many people as possible. Though I
 do need to find more or better ways to support people who it might not 
help, as that is what I have been called to do.
[Nova17Delta]: Live in spite of all the people who put you down
[TYUKASHII]: yes
[Agreeable_Candle_461]: r/DoomerCircleJerk
[TzDempsey]: we're just raw dogging life atp
[Bird_Master]: Yes definitely and there's nothing we can do about it and 
everything we know and love will crumble to dust, next question please.
[DizzyNClueless]: At this rate, I don't think those considering will wait that long. Sigh.
[tarchival-sage]: Non of this will matter in 60 years.
[Johnnyamaz]: I think we are going to see a rise in terrorism
[Late-Read1494]: No
[P03_M4N]: I'd be pretty surprised if we didn't as it stands the only thing 
really holding me down is the guilt I'd feel making my mom bury her 
child, and the fact that I'd be leaving my friends high and dry on rent.
 I can recognize my situation isn't the norm and I've been doing this 
depression bit since middle school, but I also know damn well I'm not 
alone in these feelings. Every few weeks I look about the laws in right 
to die countries among other things. I don't want help anymore, I feel 
like I've taken far too much already, and I'm tired of feeling like a 
basket case no matter how much I'm willing to and have given for others.
 It's not the fault of others mind you. It's just my own brain playing 
tricks and ruminating infinitely.
[[deleted]]: Honestly probably good bc the less nihilistic redditoids we have in our society the better
[TwistIllustrious9901]: I mean given how scared they are of aging, maybe
[dopef123]: Millenials had the same issues graduating at the Great Recession. 
Now most have bounced back. Almost everyone I know has a family and can 
buy homes.
Boomers will have to pass the torch soon. They’ll be going into care homes also.
[acherlyte]: The self mortality rate will probably increase as time goes on. I 
believe to stem the tide, we should vote in favor of powerful 
generalized social services like cheaper housing and free community 
college. Individually, it’s important we participate in community 
events, cultural rituals, and personal development to stave off the 
specter of depression.
[_flying_otter_]: I think gen z will be living through a new age of wars and imperialism. So instead of suicide they can just join the army.
[LowInteraction9422]: Suicide has been spiking since 2000.
[ThingsWork0ut]: I honestly do. 1/3 of our generation has already died from 
abortions. Many gen Z will not be able to retire. Owning a home is 
actually essential for retirement. With the struggles many gen z have 
had, many gen z are paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to invest. 
Many gen z making below 3k a month are struggling.
I just got rid of a lot of debt. Most of that debt was because of 
basic living costs by using cc to pay bills. I know a lot of people 
don’t have that same opportunity as I did to start paying off debts. So I
 do fear that a lot of gen z will commit suicide.
Suicide does nothing, there will be no pity from the world. only 
sorrow from your family. In fact I honestly believe the news will call 
them weak, irresponsible, and much more. In fact, I believe that the 
people in Washington DC will probably use the loss of Gen Z life as a 
political gain, to further their political careers, but nothing more.
Committing that act will not make anyone a martyr. If you leap 
from the windows, only the windows will be reinforced. Our society is 
very good at pointing out the individual faults than questioning the 
society faults.
Gen Z the phantom generation.
[HumanBelugaDiplomacy]: Most likely.
[countryroadhome]: No. The stigma around mental illness and support seeking is 
decreasing and the number of support services for mental health and 
mental health practitioners continues to increase. I don’t think we can 
expect any significant changes to suicide rates in this generation or 
others.
[Investment-Funny]: Likely most gen z people won't make it to their 50s due to poor 
health from unhealthy food, bad sleep, and screen time. We were doomed 
from the start, let's all give up and let the older gens deal with the 
issues themselves.

I’d (F19) say that every time I get blood tests, they always end 
up showing that I have some imbalances or anemia. I’ve never really done
 anything to change that, to be honest, but I’ve also always been 
depressed, and sometimes I get this random though
Any recommendations on how to get better without wasting too much 
money? I don't drink alcohol or smoke at all but I'm very weak
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[4isyellowTakeit5]: If you’re getting results (plural) saying you’re anemic, it’s 
absolutely impacting your long term mental health. Food makes a 
significant impact on how the body functions
In dire cases of starvation, the body can start to feed off the 
fat in your brain, one of the fattiest things in your body (or more so 
it’s unable to replace the fat that dies naturally up there? Not 
entirely sure, no expert)
[golden_alixir]: Might be worth it to talk with a dietitian and/or a therapist
[meanderingwolf]: You need to go back to your doctor and have a current set of 
bloodwork done that includes your thyroid hormones. You already admit to
 being anemic and the other potential problem that would cause weakness 
is a thyroid deficiency. Based on the results, ask the doctor for the 
best course of action to treat what you found. It may be a combination 
of medications and diet change. Simply supplementing with iron will help
 with the anemia. You can get it at any drugstore.
[kc3x]: I would say yes cause you can be eating and achieving 0 nutritional benefits,  we would need to know what you eat and such
[VanVan5937]: With the amount of information here it is impossible to say. Also a
 weird sub to choose to ask this. Go to a therapist and/or nutritionist 
and they can help more. Or post this to a more relevant sub and include 
information like how long you’ve been depressed, what your most 
prominent symptoms are, what the “imbalances” are, etc.
[Careful_Response4694]: Celiac/gluten allergies can manifest as anemia and malnutrition
[uniterofrealms_]: Take Huel

No, I don’t
Start with that. They are absolutely necessary.
[gentleteapot]: No, I don’t
Start with that. They are absolutely necessary.
[[deleted]]: Start with that. They are absolutely necessary.
[WildlyAwesome]: Potentially. What do you eat now? If I were you i would eat only 
Whole Foods, single ingredient type items. Steak and healthy fats and 
fruits. Start exercising, as simple as short walks when you can to 
start. Get sunlight as well. If the doctors say you have imbalances work
 on those as well. At my healthiest and happiest I was eating only 
steak, bacon and fruit and it wasn’t expensive.
[RedditAlwayTrue]: Stick to a balanced diet three times a day, every day, without any
 snacks, fasting, or quick meals—go back to old school dieting. Don't 
count on big pharma to handle it for you. Only you can nourish your body
 with the nutrients it needs. In just a few months, you'll be the best 
version of yourself.

or so. I have a full-time job so it keeps me occupied socially. I spend a
 lot of time just talking to online friends that I play video games with
 and all that seems to be enough for me
[torchbearer69420]: Yes I've been depressed on and off for about 10 years now. Having 1
 friend that I hang out with once or twice a month doesn't help.
[RoofEven6082]: I know what you mean, I used to not have social media and relied 
only on whatsapp and meeting IRL for friends. It's more real that way.
I had a group of friends I considered close but they eventually 
felt like they would not give me the time of day if I asked. I invited 
them out to stuff but usually they never replied, said they were busy or
 only replied to each other.
One day, my uni assignment was to do some social media task and I 
created my instagram account for the first time ever — for work/school 
mind you. But after the task, I started posting some things from my life
 and strangely enough it went kind of viral. Till this day I don't know 
why, it's just some working out videos and food photos.
Anyway, I didn't think much of it and continued as I am. But about
 3 months later, one of my friends from this group found out about my 
slightly popular IG. They started responding to my invites more and ecen
 asked me the weirdest question "Will you be my friend?" I'm like, "I'm 
already your friend?" and she explained she meant on instagram. They 
treated me very differently, they replied to everything I said and 
emoted every message.
...I fucking left the group and deleted their contacts.
All I am saying is, your 'friends' may have been like mine were. 
Popularity chasers who are charismatic in real life but really all they 
want is fame, I found out just how fake they are when their attitudes 
switched to the better just because I have an IG.
My advice? I can't say this will work as I am doing this right 
now, go around and find groups of people who don't have social media 
either. Or don't want to. They might be better friends than any of the 
Idiotgrammars.
[y2khitman]: Yes. I only have 2 real close friends. A few more in various and sundry states of strained relationships.
Part of that is my fault for pushing people away. Part of it is circumstances beyond my control.
At least I can take solace knowing I'm far from alone in this plight.
[Enemyoftheearth]: I have no IRL friends at all to give a shit about me in the first place lol.
[austinproffitt23]: No.
[dominosoverph]: Are you a teenager

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Hey guys, so I’m 25 and currently in need of urgent advice. 
Absolutely nothing is going right in my life, nothing at all. Long story
 short, I’ve had quite a rough life so far, I’ve been suffering from 
depression for a long time now and sadly it just seems to have amplified
 over the years.
Without going into too much detail, most of my depression stems 
from things in the past like trauma, childhood abuse, growing up poor, 
bullying, family deaths etc. However, over the past couple of years I’ve
 been steadily taking steps to better myself and my situation, things 
like working part-time jobs and saving money, going to the gym, eating 
more healthy, and recently going back to university again after dropping
 out due to mental health issues. But it still just seems so hopeless, 
there’s still so many things wrong with me and I constantly feel behind 
my peers.
I have no social life, no friends, never had a girlfriend let 
alone kissed one, broke af with student loan debt, severe acne and acne 
scars, living at home with my abusive alcoholic dad, and still dealing 
with anxiety and depression. Honestly the list just goes on, the only 
thing I have going for me is that I’m in a good program at one of the 
top universities in my country but even at that I’m struggling due to 
its difficulty.
I feel so ashamed of myself to have failed so miserably at life, 
whether that be socially, romantically and academically. I guess the 
reason I’m posting this is because while most of me thinks I should 
resort to ending it all to avoid more pain in the future, a tiny part of
 me hopes that I can turn things around. My childhood, teenage years, 
and my early twenties have been terrible so far. Does life get any 
easier as you get older?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[[deleted]]: A lot of people don’t have their shit figured out by 25.  Don’t be
 so hard on yourself.  Things will get better.  My thirties were way 
better than twenties.
[fallahthebest]: I feel so ashamed of myself to have failed so miserably at life,
Dude your 25 not 58 you have a LONG live ahead of you
[KingBowser24]: I'm also 25, you think I have it all figured out yet? Ha!
Truth be told, the best thing I've done for myself mentally in 
recent years was not comparing myself to others. I go at my own pace and
 do what I enjoy.
Even if you're wildly successful, chances are, there will still be people well ahead of you. So best not pay mind to that.
[ironheart777]: I was here a couple years ago mid pandemic because some traumatic 
shit happened. I'm now out of it and am really enjoying life. Here is 
what I did.
Start observing your life objectively and dispassionately. This 
means stop being ridiculous with your self criticism. No one thinks "wow
 I like steve but he has acne scars so now I hate him." Yes you probably
 have some issues but focus on the ones that are real and not imagined, 
which based on your list that includes things like "kissless virgin" is 
something you struggle with. No one cares if you are 25 and a virgin, no
 one.
Stop being obsessed with your depression. It's there, it sucks, it's not you.
Start noticing bad habits and stop them one at a time.
Start taking risks with regards to your social life. Talk to 
people, ask them questions, ASK THEM IF THEY WANT TO HANG OUT.
Get a skin care routine, save some money for some decent clothes, 
brush and floss your teeth every day. Focus afterwords on how fresh you 
look/feel.
Do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Combat sports are the single best anxiety 
relievers. Seriously, just start going to a class and take it seriously.
The first step is to not complain about your problems but rather start fixing them, I think your advice is good.
Op I had my first kiss at 21, I never dated in highschool but I 
don't regret a damn thing, I'm glad I waited until I was older. My 
partner has bad acne but he's still very attractive to me. You're too 
critical of yourself and not everyone will think of you the way you 
think of yourself. The more you look after yourself the better you will 
feel and you'll feel more confident.

feel and you'll feel more confident.
[tonylouis1337]: My best advice would be 1. Don't compare yourself to other people and 2. Find your "North star"
[EatPb]: You are only 25. You could double the amount of time you’ve already lived and you’d only be 50.
Let that sink in. You are 25. And honestly most of the early years
 don’t count. I’d say really only the last 10, if that matter. Think of 
how much a person grows and changes between 15 and 25. Now add another 
10 years. That’s only 35. That’s not even a middle aged adult. That’s 
not even too late to have a family, if that’s what you want. Now think 
of what I said at the start. If you doubled your life, you’d only be 50.
 And you could easily live 25 years, and MORE, after that.
Basically, your life is isn’t over. You are very young. Society 
kind of warps the way we think about things because in pop culture it 
seems like everything doing big and great things is a young adult, but 
really, you’ve barely lived.
I don’t have any advice that will fix your life right now because I
 can’t pretend like I’m any more of an expert than you, but i can 
guarantee you that your life is not over and you have not failed at 25. 
You could restart your whole life right now if that’s what you really 
wanted.
It sounds like you are already improving. I think being in school 
is a great place to be right now. Use this not only to better yourself 
and your career, but also your social life. You are in university. So 
are a large number of people in their 20s. Find people. Not even 
romantic/sexual partners. In fact, don’t start there. Genuinely just 
look for friends and the rest will follow. I think all you have to do is
 be less self critical. The average person is not going to notice your 
minor flaws as much as you do, if at all. I can’t think of a single time
 I’ve thought “oh I’m gonna avoid being friends with that guy because he
 has acne”. If you are open to new things and put yourself out there, 
you will meet people.
[Afraid-Difference250]: "Can't hurt me" by David Goggins. Give it a read
[[deleted]]: Felt this
[Jewcifer17]: Give up on sex. Women would approach you if you were fuckable. 
They want a small subset of men. Maybe you can get surgery to look 
better. Don’t stress it too hard as it’s not your fault for the current 
climate and your genetics.
[SaltyEvent3036]: My friend , you have said yourself there is a slight belief things
 can change. This is your time to either stand the fuck up or sit the 
fuck down an accept what's in front of you . My advice is as follows .
Get a new style for 1 month minimum , you can easily smash out 4 
weeks of consistency.  Change hair /beard shape. You wear printed ts now
 you wear button ups . Shop at goodwill/vinnies.  Any chance is as good 
as a holiday .
Sign up to dating apps , swipe yes on everyone with the guise that
 you are new to this and only looking for online conversation. If they 
take you in another direction great but don't force it . Your job is to 
learn how to respond an react to new people . Do not be someone that you
 have not evolved into yet, be shy clunky & unsure . This is key. 
You will develop skills by just talking to people as yourself.
Play to your strengths , doesn't matter what you look like,  it 
matters how you carry yourself . You are not the only antisocial acne 
having virgin . You're not the only person feeling down or sorry for 
yourself . Talk & participate in the things you are good at .
Be patient & remain content where you are now .  You may not 
have all the money to move from your current situation.  But your 
situation is not your final destination .
Believe in yourself as I can see that you do partly . If you don't believe in yourself,  why the f would anyone else.
To be clear . You will die one day . Sooner than you think.  Light
 some mother fucking candles and make this world your own . Youve spent 
to much time in your head and not enough time with the beliefy that you 
can do whatever you want in this time you have here.
Finally read this again.
All the best my friend
[Putrid_Doughnut6564]: This is pretty normal for people our age in today's world, just 
check up on some statistics. As for getting no play don't worry about it
 it too much either, the western dating market is completely fucked. 
Average women no longer want average men, or even good men.
Start coping or start...
[Distinct-Hearing7089]: My father suffered from deepression. I know you've probably done 
this. But, you should go to a mental hospital. They're people who will 
help you. You should never kill yourself. Especially, at such a young 
age. Get involved with clubs at university. You can't expect people to 
come to you. You have to go to them. As for complaining about being a 
virgin, work on yourself first. And then girls will like you just as 
much as you like them.
[Hefty_Poet_7553]: If you’re in a top university you’re already better off than 99% 
of people the only thing that will save you is money and you’re very 
close to it just get your degree and get a good ass job and everything 
else will fall into place. Once you can afford to move out youll get a 
girlfriend and you’ll be fine. You’re doing way better than you think.
[Trusteveryboody]: I've heard the phrase.
"one day; day one" recently. Which is good, in concept, and I love
 that; that I heard that. I personally, feel like I still can't do 
anything....and I'm not really trying to just 'play victim,' I just 
still feel like I can't.
Anyway- that's why I've taken my "drastic measure" of SSRI. Which 
whatever....That's where I'm at as a 21 year old. Loveless 
inidividual...not that I really care, but sometimes I do. Friendless, 
but I don't want friends; I don't want online friends (ESPECIALLY, not 
to come at you or anyone in particular), but I just think that's not 
where I want to be.
Time will tell.
And I'm not really with the "it's ok" mentality...because it's not
 ok. This isn't where I want to be in life. But I am, for now. It's not 
that I care about being a 'loveless' individual, it's MUCH bigger than 
that...I think that's a small thing in the grand scheme. Love is 
something that will come along WITH everything else. I feel.
And in life, I, myself, have to be a LITTLE optimistic. If you're 
not, then you're hopeless. People get this idea, that I'm exactly where I
 want to be....but, that's not correct. It's hard to even describe a 
response to that sentiment people have about me.......but like- It's 
just not that simple, if it was......then why would I even write this 
reply (for example)? If I "didn't care," I think it's evident enough 
that I care more than a person that doesn't.
...And I think there's a huge difference between people that don't
 have it figured out....and people that feel like they can't even 
"move," and I guess I feel like I can't even "move." And telling me that
 I don't have it figured out, is just ignoring the issue; not that 
anyone knows my issues (and I'm intentionally vague, because it's not 
something I need to get into)...but I'm just saying.I could listen 
to all the advice in the world, all the self-help in the world; it 
wouldn't change anything. I know the MENTALITIES, and people will think 
that that means I'm the issue. I think sometimes it's more than a 
mentality that's keeping someone behind. I think that applies to 
me.....again not to play a 'victim,' but I feel like I know the 
mentalities, and no matter how many I hear (no matter how many I myself 
think), it won't change anything.
[que-bella]: you’re still so young you have so much more to learn and 
experience. this age is difficult and your 20s are a hard coming of age 
period for a lot of people. don’t give up, keep focusing on yourself and
 doing what makes you feel good, it’s not easy but a lot of good things 
will come in time
[Clitoris_-Rex]: Hey friend, I’m kind of in a similar place too, 19F. I’m planning 
on self improvement as well and I think it’s great that you’re taking 
that route too. Ofc we can change things around, remember this situation
 is not permanent. You can dm me if you want to talk or vent. 💖
[Cautious_Piglet5425]: I feel for you brother all you can do is believe things will get 
better and know you’re capable of anything you set your mind to. This 
too shall pass. Good luck.
[[deleted]]: I can't help you with the trauma or the other things you struggle 
with except for one thing; There is always a someone for everyone out 
there, I mean that literally. With enough confidence, you'd be 
surprised. Don't give up
[ThatGuyMarlin]: First step is always to change your environment and leave the shit behind you.
I suggest serving in your local military as a way out.

I thought I did everything I was supposed to do. I got my STEM 
degree, I started working as a software engineer, everything was going 
great. I got tons of offers, progressed in my career, everything was 
awesome
But for the last year (2025) I've been completely lost. Trump won 
the election and my life completely changed. STEM is now useless, 
anti-intellectualism is on the rise and everyone is just rushing towards
 getting me replaced
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[[deleted]]: Trump is investing trillions into AI technology. It doesn't matter
 if it replaces me or not because either way my field will suffer
AI replaces me? I lose my job and we're at the end game of capitalism
It fails? Huge financial IT crash that will take years to recover
There is nowhere but down from here on out the coming 5-10 years
I am not trying to downplay what you are saying, but there is a 
good chance none  of what you are concerned about will happen. There are
 countless wrong predictions.
10 years ago truck drivers were told their jobs would be taken over by autonomous vehicles.
Nobody was investing trillions of dollars to specifically replace 
truck workers.. they were just investing in vehicle automation and 
predicted truck workers as being replaced
The problem with AI is that its already set in motion. It is 
specifically designed to replace workers there is literally no other use
 case for it. All the students or regular people using these tools arent
 the target audience
You are making an assumption based on conjecture.
No, my assumption is based on CEOs going out in public stating "we
 are replacing everyone!" While laying off 1/3rd of their staff
The same CEOs who, years ago, claimed autonomous vehicles would be
 the norm by now.... and not only are they not the standard, they don't 
come even 50% close to what the manufacturers promised.  And, most of 
them have abandoned the concept outright.  I work in CA for the DMV, and
 it's asinine how ALL companies have lied (and had their permits 
suspended or revoked).  Even Tesla.
Don't let sociopathic CEOs and billionaires rain on your parade - 
so to speak.   Look.  I get from where you're coming.  But I've lived 
thru the dot com fiasco, as well as everything since, and I'm telling 
you that what some of these people are announcing isn't about reality, 
but all about hyping up their new toy in order to gain more investment 
opportunities so they don't have to risk their own wealth.  It's the 
same fucking story every time.  Don't let the Richie Riches put you 
down.  And don't believe them just bc they're over the companies for 
which they speak.  They are literally paid to do so and get investors 
plus the public on board.  It's a scam, a legal scam.
These CEOs are either
A. morons who don't actually understand how "AI" (technically LLMs, a completely different technology) works, or
B. they know how it works and are just making up bullshit for 
investors to keep throwing money away chasing the dragon of "AI to 
replace all the heckin' workers!!!"
Bonus points if they are from some "next big thing" AI startup whose "flagship product" is just another ChatGPT wrapper.
no, they are not. I’m a software engineer as well and trust me, 
we’re aware of real things happening in our market. one of those is a 
big push for AI so that there’s less need for real engineers & 
therefore less money to pay in salary.
As Chud's Law of Happenings states, "Nothing Ever Happens"
It's hard to believe, but truck driving used to be a six figure 
job in the 70s-90s.  It was dumbed down/masses sent to do it, and 
poof...terrible life today.  They still have a job, but it's a shell of 
what it used to be and it is dwindling
Maybe, look for work in a different field? Instead of bitching on 
Reddit, be a damn adult and keep moving forward. No one is preventing 
you from getting into the trades, finding a job in the financial 
industry, or anything else.
Everyone always say this "just go to a new field bro" but like, I 
have a fucking job? Lmao and it's not poorly paid either. What im 
depressed about is that it's a regressing field. The "software dev" 
dream is long dead and there won't be any cool interesting jobs from 
here on out, just capitalist grinding
Which is.. fine, it just makes it like any other job. But I got 
into this field from passion and I hate to use my art form just as a 
capitalist grind
You went from saying "STEM is useless" to basically saying that 
you have a very good well paying job, but it's just not fun anymore. Boo
 hoo, pull it in a notch drama queen.
Selling your art has always been a capitalist grind.  You can still practice your art form for your own enjoyment
Being a software dev used to be exciting and an artform
I'm in tech so I understand your doom and gloom about the 
industry.  I'd suggest you widen your lens and look at the bigger 
timeline.  AI is currently a hot buzzword and will eventually change the
 landscape.  But its limited by its access to real data models (most 
companies won't willingly hand over their code and data to train it) and
 by access to data center infrastructure.  Every AI company is 
overstating their capabilities right now in order to gain access to 
market shares.  Maybe reading into that will help ease your mind for the
 immediate future.
He's a software engineer. You don't just go into financial which 
btw is alreast being replaced by Ai faster than programming

Don't let sociopathic CEOs and billionaires rain on your parade - 
so to speak.   Look.  I get from where you're coming.  But I've lived 
thru the dot com fiasco, as well as everything since, and I'm telling 
you that what some of these people are announcing isn't about reality, 
but all about hyping up their new toy in order to gain more investment 
opportunities so they don't have to risk their own wealth.  It's the 
same fucking story every time.  Don't let the Richie Riches put you 
down.  And don't believe them just bc they're over the companies for 
which they speak.  They are literally paid to do so and get investors 
plus the public on board.  It's a scam, a legal scam.
These CEOs are either
A. morons who don't actually understand how "AI" (technically LLMs, a completely different technology) works, or
B. they know how it works and are just making up bullshit for 
investors to keep throwing money away chasing the dragon of "AI to 
replace all the heckin' workers!!!"
Bonus points if they are from some "next big thing" AI startup whose "flagship product" is just another ChatGPT wrapper.
[LuvLaughLive]: The same CEOs who, years ago, claimed autonomous vehicles would be
 the norm by now.... and not only are they not the standard, they don't 
come even 50% close to what the manufacturers promised.  And, most of 
them have abandoned the concept outright.  I work in CA for the DMV, and
 it's asinine how ALL companies have lied (and had their permits 
suspended or revoked).  Even Tesla.

[pauIblartmaIIcop]: no, they are not. I’m a software engineer as well and trust me, 
we’re aware of real things happening in our market. one of those is a 
big push for AI so that there’s less need for real engineers & 
therefore less money to pay in salary.
[PermissionSoggy891]: As Chud's Law of Happenings states, "Nothing Ever Happens"
[chrissul13]: It's hard to believe, but truck driving used to be a six figure 
job in the 70s-90s.  It was dumbed down/masses sent to do it, and 
poof...terrible life today.  They still have a job, but it's a shell of 
what it used to be and it is dwindling
[tankman714]: Maybe, look for work in a different field? Instead of bitching on 
Reddit, be a damn adult and keep moving forward. No one is preventing 
you from getting into the trades, finding a job in the financial 
industry, or anything else.
Everyone always say this "just go to a new field bro" but like, I 
have a fucking job? Lmao and it's not poorly paid either. What im 
depressed about is that it's a regressing field. The "software dev" 
dream is long dead and there won't be any cool interesting jobs from 
here on out, just capitalist grinding
Which is.. fine, it just makes it like any other job. But I got 
into this field from passion and I hate to use my art form just as a 
capitalist grind
You went from saying "STEM is useless" to basically saying that 
you have a very good well paying job, but it's just not fun anymore. Boo
 hoo, pull it in a notch drama queen.
Selling your art has always been a capitalist grind.  You can still practice your art form for your own enjoyment
Being a software dev used to be exciting and an artform
I'm in tech so I understand your doom and gloom about the 
industry.  I'd suggest you widen your lens and look at the bigger 
timeline.  AI is currently a hot buzzword and will eventually change the
 landscape.  But its limited by its access to real data models (most 
companies won't willingly hand over their code and data to train it) and
 by access to data center infrastructure.  Every AI company is 
overstating their capabilities right now in order to gain access to 
market shares.  Maybe reading into that will help ease your mind for the
 immediate future.
He's a software engineer. You don't just go into financial which 
btw is alreast being replaced by Ai faster than programming

[PermissionSoggy891]: I concur with the paper, AI is fuckass useless coding in any real 
projects. I tested some debugging with ChatGPT with some projects I was 
working on before, it genuinely couldn't give any useful advice other 
than just summarizing what the code did and what packages I was using.
[Cozy_Kale]: anti-intellectualism is on the rise and everyone is just rushing towards getting me replaced
I feel you. I finished classics international and  moving 
into sociology/humanities faculty. Enrollments are down by 1/4, right 
when we need people who can discuss society. I know five languages, but 
language studies are declining too. Overall, it’s a rough time to see a 
future, but things will change hopefully 🍀
Discussing society doesn't get the bills paid
yeah I don’t know anyone that’s still studying humanities. Almost 
all of my friends are doing practical and secure jobs like nursing, med 
school, law school, finance, and engineering. If they’re not in 
university they’re in trade school. Silly to do humanities in this 
economy. Going into debt for a humanities degree in this job market is 
signing yourself up for homelessness.
I know Latin and 5 languages but served at tables this summer 🥀     I love my studies tho.
Yeah, but someone got to explain why the bills keep going up. Many
 of these studies, just like arts, shaped the world for the better even 
if are not profitable careers.
I don’t see an easy way and I will probably end broke on the streets, but at least I tried to change things.

[[deleted]]: Yes modern times are depressing. I would say Anti Intellectualism 
rose in 2013 and beyond, when people got smartphones and social media. 
Likes replaced logic and followers replaced facts. This is all much more
 blatant and in our faces, now that long time institutions such as media
 and politicians and stable corporations, have also bought into anti 
intellectualism. The good news for many of us is that a lot of people 
also hate this and are starving to have some type of stimulating 
discussion, offline, with many nuances and covering all sides of any 
issue. Most people aren’t bad man, they are just propagandized.
You're right, I've theorized about the post-fact society for years
 now but I was never truly "afraid" of it, was just this silly thing 
that didn't really matter either way
But right now... I don't even know what's going on anymore. Many 
people in my family started watching TikTok when it came out and kept 
sending me obvious propaganda clips and called it "facts" and now AI 
came out and my parents are hooked. Talking to their AI daily and taking
 everything it says on face value
It's just depressing to view and its nothing I can control because it's not about me, but everyone around me.
I love that term “post fact society”
Yes everything you have described is significantly depressing.
I used to cringe at the idea of living in a small town - 5,000 or 
less. Now I’m not opposed to it, but not for reasons like low cost of 
living and non existent crime. Those people still value face to face 
conversations and are willing to listen intently. I think it’s an unfair
 stereotype to call them stupid. If there was a true small town that was
 flaming liberal, I would move there tomorrow.
There are liberal small towns. I’ve lived in two. They’re fucking awesome, highly recommend.
Oh this is amazing, I’ll Google, thank you. Don’t get me wrong, a 
conservative small town is cool too. Those people generally would give 
the shirt off their back, even if a person treated them badly. Overall 
high character and hard workers.

[MadMysticMeister]: I think you might need to touch grass, and i mean that 
respectfully. I think a lot of nihilism comes from being too close to 
the news feed, and being too overly focused on specific events, take a 
step back from it all and focus on what you can actually do. If you 
believe great change is coming figure out how to prepare for it, 
whatever happens happens, if it’s out of your control then control the 
way you choose to react to it.
I’ve read some of your other comments here and with ai in 
particular i see and relate to where you’re coming from, I’m a truck 
driver, automation is a very common topic to speak about, and honestly i
 see it in a positive light. Machines don’t get tired, they don’t road 
rage, or drive under the influence, they simply function and if truck 
drivers have to put up their keys in the name of bettering society so be
 it, it’s progress, and I don’t wish to get in the way of it. Now 
complete and utter automation is probably 50 or 60 years out i’m will to
 wager, things happen where a human is better suited for the task, and 
someone needs to be on the side of the road when something breaks.
Same with stem, they’re might be layoffs but not everyone can be 
thrown out, you’ll need people who actually know what’s happening, and 
ai will probably just be another tool for those in you field to use. 
Basically it’ll be a great change like the internet i think, game 
changing but not the end of the world.
[Xera_Reddit]: Felt that mang I was set to go to school for motion design but got
 talk out of it because “art school bad” and where we are at rn with ai I

 shame to see so many types of arts destroyed by company greed

[unapologeticopinions]: I’ve been there. This is gonna ruffle some feathers, but becoming a

Results may vary, do not take “becoming a parent” if you’re 
addicted to drugs or alcohol, have psychosis or other mental ailments. 
Side effects include but are not limited to, delayed gratification, 
excitement, tiredness, nausea, general disgust, endless laughter and 
cuddles, dirty kitchens and getting weirded out when strangers kiss your
 baby. Talk to your doctor before trying “becoming a parent” and discuss
 with your partner.

[_Traditional_]: You’re blaming a president for ruining your life? This lack of accountability will get you nowhere.
Additionally, STEM is the opposite of useless; in fact, it’s now 
more useful than ever. You don’t deserve a job just because you obtained
 a degree and think you’re educated.
This year you’ll blame AI and Trump, in 3 years you’ll blame 
something else. They’re not the root issue here. Either adapt, or don’t.
 It’s that simple.
Now more useful than ever?? Why would you say that? 3 years ago I 
had companies at my fingertips, literally kissing my feet to have me 
working for them
STEM has never been more useless than it is right now
I think what they mean is that everything is going digital and 
involves computers and technology. Things may suck now, but something 
will emerge, a different kind of opportunity for those like you, and 
eventually it will have to get better. Because how things are going 
currently can’t last.
Just because everything is digital doesn't mean it creates job 
opportunities. Everything in life is biological yet there aren't much 
biology science jobs
You mean during a pandemic where companies were rushing to trying a
 capitalize on digital services for everyone forced to be stuck at home?
Your career/degree was already going out the door before Trump 
even took office. Practically every software/cs reddit I see the woes of
 poor job prospects due to Indians (who oversaturate the market) working
 for cheap + HB1 visa abuse.
Trump clamping down on Indian visas has beenapplauded/cheeredon by US CompSci grads.
I didn’t say a STEM degree is more useful for getting a job than 
ever, simply that STEM is more useful than ever due to technological 
trends. We’re going to need more AI specialists in the STEM field, and 
you know better than most that AI can’t take a simple prompt to a fully 
functioning application.
There are plenty of useful ways to use your skills that our market demands, and companies supply this demand with hiring.
Markets are adapting meaning skill sets require adaptation too.
I know the job market is tough, and I know adapting and having to 
create proof of what you know (via projects) isn’t easy; But the reality
 is that there are many people obtaining roles because they’ve struggled
 too and have had to learn & build more.
By the time the job market improves, you’ll be more knowledgeable 
and more credible. There are still jobs you can get today though, just 
maybe not what you want.
Tech was propped up by trillions on COVID money and subsequent 
labor hoarding and inflation, and the lockdowns. Sounds like you’re just
 complaining that the gravy train is coming back down to earth.

follow the same beliefs instead of thinking to themselves "what would

watch TV. Ask yourself why you're torturing yourself like this, and then
 you'll eventually realise how much you fucked up.
How should I get food and shelter if I don't have a job?
Live with your parents, like I do. It sounds bad like ur taking 
advantage but that's what society wants you to think so you feel 
pressured to get a job. Sure you might get shit from family but I'd 
rather get nagged at by family than commute to work for hours every day.
 I came to this realisation after years of school and doing work 
afterwards. I was like "wtf this sucks" and now I'm just relaxing.
Yeah good idea because everyone just has parents that can support them???

rather get nagged at by family than commute to work for hours every day.
 I came to this realisation after years of school and doing work 
afterwards. I was like "wtf this sucks" and now I'm just relaxing.
Yeah good idea because everyone just has parents that can support them???

[Notmainlel]: Stop blaming Trump for your issues and take responsibility
I cannot afford therapy or medication bc Trump passed the big beautiful bill.
Fuck you.
Trump is to blame for many many horrible changes and it’s going to
 get worse before it gets better. I want the OP to keep doing his best 
and not give up, but it’s objectively true that we’re in an unregulated 
capitalism hellscape now. Fascism, matched with incredible stupid greed.
> Stop blaming Trumpwhy ? he is a child rapist elected as 
president for "make America great again" . Under his pathetic leadership
 government is shutdown
what an insane thing to say when Trump and his cronies have 
influenced terrible things to happen all around us, that have real 
effects. get over yourself
What do you want me to do? I'm open to options
Start your own business. Start-ups, if you have the talent, have 
never been in a better position to benefit greatly from today's business
 scene.
With what funding??
Banks offer loans.
Or you can look for entrepreneurial/start-up grants.
Helps if you have a portfolio or created a personal project to show.
OH WHAT A GREAT IDEA! I should just take on massive risks and potentially indebt myself for the rest of my life
You don't need to "take on massive risks and potentially indebt 
myself for the rest of my life" to create a little side project to make 
yourself stand out.
And you do realize that a sizable amount of small businesses rely 
on loans. Also, unlike student debt, you can declare bankruptcy if you 
truly fuck up and your plan doesnt work out.

Does anyone on here have a solution for depression that's not drugs or pills?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[bg370]: Therapy and taking it seriously. Meds may either be helpful or required depending on condition.
[Defined-Fate]: Wake up at 6-7am and spend 1-2 hours in the morning sun / nature.
Drink and eat less, but more healthily as well.
Try to do more exercise.
Try to talk to people more. Even if it's strangers and you just 
say hello as they walk by. Talk to family and friends more. Get off of 
screens.
Have a goal. Even if you don't know what you want to do in life. Start small and build your way up.
[bxdtxste]: I have one, come talk with the spx6900 community. We're live on 
spaces as we speak. The spaces go on for 6.9 days, so feel free to hop 
on and cure some of that depression.
This is not a joke, I was mentally healed through this beautiful 
community of pure hearted people in this depressing world.
[Temporary_Copy3897]: meaningful hobbies. for me i like to ride horse. whenever i'm at 
the barn i forget about any challenge i'm having during the week
[Distinct_Weird6906]: therapy, exercise, and finding hobbies can help but it varies for 
everyone, maybe talk to a professional to explore options that suit you
[thepeakof06]: Getting off Reddit
[DummyThiccDude]: Meds definitely helped me at the start. But having a hobby helps too.
One thing that always gives me some zest for life is going on a 
road trip. Getting out of the apartment and seeing something new is just
 a good feeling.
It depends on the individual, though.
[IanTheAeon]: Community. People. Look intor/spx6900. It brought me sobriety and cured my depression.
[One_Patience5631]: I found Jesus
[[deleted]]: Sex
The number of virgins in America just hit an all time high. No wonder theyre so depressed.
That would be nice but actually finding someone would be difficult, I'm not good at talking to people.

My life was amazing in 2014 (diary of a Wimpy kid, gta 5, good at 
academics and not depressed) I don't know why but 2016 seems kinda 
cursed me
I have never achieved the 2014-15 level hapiness till now...why ?

[Smiles4YouRawrX3]: Things went downhill after the death of a certain gorilla in Cincinnati.
2016 beginning was kinda depressing but things did worse in June. (Harambe died on May 28)
I am going to the zoo with my girlfriend where our glorious Harambe was born to pay tribute to him.
28, not 26
People always say that it was when Harambe died that things 
started getting shitty... but I think it was actually when Robin 
Williams died.
God I miss him man, fuck. One of my favorite actors of all time :(
2016 was rife with celebrity deaths, many of which had a profound impact on my childhood.
He was the good timeline's anchor being.
Ahh, the great disaster. How I remember, it was like yesterday!

[josephms125]: I think part of the reason it feels that way is because we were 
younger and less prone to paying attention  to the issues leading up to 
2016
I dunno - I’m 61 and I’ve always paid attention, and I feel like OP does.
Maybe… I definitely feel that way at least and typically associate a similar feeling to the people of my age group
Yeah, I get it but I don’t think it’s just your age group, though 
you might have different reasons for feeling that way. I’m just saying a
 lot of people of all ages feel that way.
I fully agree. I just think that this point is especially of note 
with this particular group because media has increased by a substantial 
margin and I feel lime OP has a credible point with this generation in 
particular. But i definitely get what you’re saykng
I get what you (and OP) are saying too. There are no doubt some aspects of this that are unique to your generation.
If you’re 61 why do you have comments saying you’re 13?
Haha… no, I do not.

[tonylouis1337]: The 90s into the mid 2000s was the best time ever, minus of course a certain event in 2001
[xSparkShark]: I would be useful in this discussion to mention what year you were born…
There’s a reason we have a whole genre of movies called “coming of
 age” films. There’s a reason that different religions and cultures have
 celebrations at various points during adolescence. The first 10 or so 
years of your life are far more likely to be remembered as great because
 you had no responsibilities and lacked any real self examination 
ability.
Being born in 01, yeah life was pretty fucking awesome up until 
around 2016. Getting prepared for the adulthood, college, the real 
world, etc. definitely hits a lot of people like ton of bricks, myself 
included. I don’t think this has anything to do with 2015 specifically 
though. I think people in 07 probably thought 2016-2019 was pretty 
great.
I will say 2016 xxl freestyle came out that year the world peaked
2001
[[deleted]]: 2001
[[deleted]]: Honestly, I will always prefer the early 2000s than 2010s.
Due to internet not being mainstream ?
Yes, and also, that was my core childhood. 2000 to 2006.

[MarkintheDark_888]: For me it's been like a pattern. 2010-2014 was good for me, 
2015-mid 2018 things were starting to be rough for me and a bit weird 
for me as I was very socially awkward back then and had to deal with 
being picked on a lot, late 2018 to early 2022  things were getting a 
bit better though that period of time still had the issues I faced 
before but it was at a lesser extent, though unfortunately things 
started to get a bit rough again in 2020 due to the pandemic, but then 
mid 2022 onwards things are back to being weird for me. I wouldn't say I
 want to relive the rough years as a middle schooler or an early high 
schooler again without the knowledge I have in 2025, but right now it's 
pretty much the same so I don't know
[EllieEvansTheThird]: It was hardly perfect, but I definitely noticed a rapid downhill dive after 2016 and we just went off a cliff after 2020
[FiveSixSleven]: From 2019 until three months ago, my life has gotten better with 
every year. I met my wife, married, had our first child, and I'm now 
pregnant with our second.
Other than the fear of dark days to come, my life is wonderful.
Congrats
Thank you. If there is a ban on IVF, this will also be my last child if I choose to remain in the United States.

[CountyTop8606]: I don't feel that way. Movies sucked, music sucked, fashion 
sucked. Like dumb commentary YouTube and haha so random "absurd" deep 
fried humor was everywhere on the Internet. I really didn't like that 
whole era. Things are much better off now. Also being independent and an
 adult is fucking great, it's good to remember how much being a kid 
actually sucks.

[xJUN3x]: 90s-2007 was the best time in modern history. 08-15 was alright. 16-19 too. 2021 onwards is shit.
[Bman1465]: I was the prized trophy object in the middle of a divorce between 
two parents who hated eachother so much they didn't even hesitate to use
 manipulation of their kid, bribing and abuse of all kinds to fuck the 
other up, and my dad ditched me when I was a preteen so I essentially 
grew up without a father figure in the stage of life where I needed it 
the most. On top of that, a hyperperfectionist and obsessive homo 
autismus child in the middle of an extremely toxic and abusive household
 with no friends at school and who got bullied every single day for 13 
years.
2016 was the year that broke Western society (i.e. Brexit made the
 current form of making politics based on fear and antisistemic 
antiintellectualism, where everything is relative and we can make up 
facts and history and stats as we will and the voters are so done with 
traditional parties they'll listen to anyone else), and Harambe's death 
and TikTok's creation broke the timeline, sure.
But outside of a teeny tiny window in 2012, I don't think my life 
has been any better now. At least my family members aren't trying to 
murder eachother anymore, and my dad is back from his time abroad. Still
 hard asf, but better.
On top of that, many people were affected by the Recession and had their lives ruined over it.
Life has never been perfect for anyone. Ever. It's just that, 
since we're so dependent on tech and social media and broadcasting our 
lives on a daily basis, we're just more aware. Things have gotten worse,
 others have gotten better. All in all, life's the same.
Same as it ever was.
I am really sorry for those things, more power to you.
Just a tip - try to have a job that won't feel like a burden...you have already been through a lot.
Oh dw about it, I love what I'm majoring in and I'm literally 
writing a resume rn to apply to what seems might be a really good 
position :3c
Beyond that, I have big dreams and a big spirit, albeit doubt always finds its way into my heart, can't lie

[FinnMertensHair]: Life was good until 2011 to me. I'm just surviving 'cause suicide is not an option to me atm.
[Happy-Viper]: You grew up.
[GoldieDoggy]: Definitely not perfect for me. We had to put down our family dog, 
April, around like 2010? Maybe 2009-ish. Loved her. Then, September of 
2011, we were in the hospital waiting room, late at night. Only 
child-friendly thing on at the time (I was like 6 or 7. Don't want to do
 the math rn) was the Power Rangers. First and last time I ever watched 
that show. Later that night, the doctor came out to tell all of us that 
Mom Mom (my mom's mom, lol) was gone. She had cancer, I don't remember 
exactly what type(s).
It got worse from there. Honestly, most things before 2009 and 
after 2015 were so much better for me, although I don't remember too 
much from pre-2009, lol
[rasmuscraine]: Elder millennial here. I agree.

[Grumblepugs2000]: 2020 is when everything went to shit. 2016-2019 were great: low 
inflation,  lots of economic growth, better global relations, ect. 
It was only bad if you were drunk on TDS propaganda from the MSM clowns 
(who were mad their establishment puppet didn't win and never got over 
it). The main thing I hope for the next Trump term is he realizes the 
administrative state is NOT his friend, he was way too trusting of them 
the last time around
Saying TDS sincerely makes you sound like a boomer. What are you doing in this sub.
Bro is surprised to learn not all gen zers support socialism...
One could theoretically be a conservative without worshipping a 
business cheat. But I guess fundamentally the real American dream is 
screwing people over so you can be rich without working. Glad your set 
is admitting it so we can move on.

I don’t know what it is but the older I get and the more I learn 
about/observe the world, the more depressed and jaded I become.
What do I honestly have to look forward to as a young person in the world today?
-Our governments are run by walking skeletons who are out of touch with the common person
-Everything is expensive as shit, the economy is terrible
-Most people have to live with their parents because they can’t afford to make it on their own
-AI is slowly creeping into life and it’s actually terrifying
-There’s an ongoing genocide being broadcasted live in HD and most people in power don’t really seem to care
-You have no choice but to become a cog in the capitalist machine, or else you’ll be homeless and unable to live
It’s just… how do you remain positive and hopeful in light of 
these sorts of things? I know the most likely response is “get off the 
internet” but some of this stuff still affects me in my day to day life.
 I graduate college in a year and there’s no way I’ll be able to live on
 my own afterwards.
I love art, I love creating things, I have a bunch of hobbies and I
 know exactly who I am as a person. I just hate the system that governs 
life in the modern day and it just bums me out and sucks all the life 
and joy out of me. I’m not an economist but I just know there HAS to be a
 better system out there than this. There’s no way this is the optimum 
one.  Literally the only material thing I want in life is to own a small
 home just so I can have that baseline security, but even that seems so 
out of reach during these times.
It’s gotten to a point where I find myself fantasizing about 
getting cancer so I can be free of this nonsense and not have to 
participate in the game anymore.
How do you guys stay sane and hopeful?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[four_eyed_doorstop]: I like the phrase "fuck it, we ball"
“Just another day homie”
For me it's "It it what it it" or "YOLO"
Combined with the phrase “ball is life”, and it becomes an even 
more profound turn of phrase. -stole this idea straight from a TikTok
Or as walter sobchak wisely said to the dude, "fuck it dude, lets go bowling"

[Alternative_Poem445]: the apathy is your body telling u to be lazy. its an evolutionary 
trait. i too feel purposeless and very immobile. i assume the roof over 
my head will be gone any moment.
[YawgmothwasRight]: Existing is living, don't let social media or life shown by entertainment outlets fool you.
[[deleted]]: I feel a lot of the same things as you. It’s extremely tough to 
think about. The thing that keeps me going is that time marches on. 
Eventually those skeletons you talked about really will be skeletons and
 we can take their place and try to run things better. People in this 
sub have tried to insult me by saying I’m “overly optimistic” and that 
“every generation says that,” but choosing to believe things won’t get 
better isexactly whythey won’t. We’ve got to try at least.
Other than that, I’ve got small goals I’m trying to focus on to 
not fall into despair at the political climate in the meantime. Getting 
in better shape, doing online college courses since I can’t afford a 
proper one, finding a girlfriend, and someday hopefully starting a 
family. Even if my life never ends up being good, I believe I have a 
shot at setting up my future child with the advantages I never had, and 
that makes me motivated!
The thing that keeps me going is that time marches on. Eventually 
those skeletons you talked about really will be skeletons and we can 
take their place and try to run things better.
I think you nailed it. History is cyclical. 1880 to 1920 was a 
terrible time of income inequality and rich barons feeding us scraps and
 even murdering union leaders to take away labor rights. The generations
 that suffered under that built a robust regulatory state filled with 
social programs during 1930 to 1950, which brought us out of despair and
 into prosperity. From 1980 to present day, the boomers took power, 
destroyed those foundations, and pulled the ladder up behind them in an 
attempt to hoard their wealth and leave us in the dust.
The last four decades of antisocial governance and policymaking has brought us here and left Millenials and Gen Z shafted.
But the greedy old fucks are all retiring and dying off extremely 
quickly. Wait until we start to run things. Just wait. We're gonna swing
 it back around. I'm an elder Millennial but I feel like our generation 
is a sprinter on the starting line waiting for the starting gun to go 
off so we can take the reins and get to work making the world a better 
place.

I disagree. I think believing people can fix things if they just 
wait long enough is precisely why nothing happens. Everyone is too 
hopeful. There is no fire, no urgency to fix anything. Just waiting for 
their turn only to eventually realize that when the time they thought 
they'd be in charge comes, they aren't, the children of the skeletons 
get to inherit the power and wealth of their parents and they quite like
 the system.
What you say does ring true, but hope is not passiveness. Having 
hope doesn’t mean you’re just going to sit there and assume everything’s
 going to be fine without trying. Hope keeps you from falling into 
despair and gives you the drive to make the change you want to see 
happen. Furthermore the “children” of these politicians can’t just 
inherit these political positions. This is a democracy. We already have a
 Gen Z congressman, we just need to keep running, keep campaigning, and 
keep putting in the work.
I have hope that my future child’s life will be better than mine, 
but that hope is because I plan to put in the work to make it that way. 
With enough saving up with a partner and what little inheritance money 
we may receive from our parents we could probably afford a small house 
in our 50s/60s. By the time we pass shortly after; our own kid, and 
their future family will inherit that house to live in or sell, thus 
securing a more financially secure life than me.
TLDR: hope for the future doesn’t necessarily make you passive; 
it’s a direct result of deciding not to be passive. I have hope for my 
future and potential family’s future because I’m willing to put in the 
work.
I see it a bit differently, I dont see the state of the world 
improving at least for a good while from now. If anything, i expect it 
will get much worse by the time im old.
But fuck whatever gets in the way of me enjoying life, the world 
sucks and is going to shit but i dont want to spend my life lamenting 
over it, i just want to make the most of the very short lifespan we are 
given. I truly hope the we all get our heads straight and fix these 
systemic issues, but i dont expect it to happen anytime soon

[[deleted]]: I’d like to challenge that opinion by recommending a book: “Humankind” by Rutger Bregman
[thatdude807]: You sound like an intelligent person and sometimes being smart is a
 dual-edged sword. It’s advantageous in certain ways, but it’s also hard
 in that you understand some of the ugly parts about how the world 
works.
What I would say is that it sounds like if you’re worrying about 
all of these things so much (and it’s valid, don’t get me wrong), you 
may be missing one or more of the following.
A strong community and can give back to
A prospect of a career or purpose that you love
A great friend group or family
A significant other
A pet
Hobbies that bring you closer to people
Overall, you seem so suffer from what so many of us do, which is 
loneliness. Perhaps I’m wrong in my diagnosis, but feel free to DM me if
 you ever need to talk!
[Free-Database-9917]: Not who you asked but in a similar position. Honestly, I got out 
through recognizing that my best way to help others is to help myself 
first. I wanted to be able to contribute to local organizations. I 
choose to work in a field that I like less that pays the bills better 
because extra money I receive can go towards either directly helping 
friends, family, and my community, or indirectly through giving me more 
free time.
Having a partner who you can support and they, you, means that 
getting through hard times becomes a ton easier, and additionally more 
fulfilling.
Recognizing that your influence on the world isn't as strong as 
you think it is but can be stronger means you maybe shouldn't try and 
solve a conflict you believe goes against your morals across the country
 when you should instead see if there is a way you can volunteer to help
 clean local parks.
I think finding things you enjoy doing and using that to give 
back. You like going on runs? Take a trashbag with you! You enjoy a 
niche sport? Start a sports club at your local rec center! Start a band 
that spreads messages you believe in. Volunteer for a local politician's
 campaign that you believe strongly in. Worrying about your neighbor and
 how you can improve yourself for them is an important step 1.
I like to think by the time I am retirement age, I will have 
significant impacts on the world, but even if not, I will have made 
significant impacts on as many people as I can
[allurboobsRbelong2us]: Not the person you asked but really... simplify. In my 20s I felt 
like we were taking on the world. It was stressful, always being 
informed to the teeth.
It was better to keep good ethics and morals and use them to steer
 my everyday life. Treat everyone I met with a smile and make their life
 easier, even if they were morbidly obese karens. Forgive more, care 
less.
[pleasent_shelter4742]: If your read his other comments or posts you will in fact see he does NOT have the life that you want 😭
[WildDaikonRadish]: I rarely look at the news anymore and as bad as it sounds I just 
focus on my own day to day life and social circle. I'll distract myself 
with things I enjoy like games, food and pets.
You are smart
Same for the most part. There are certain issues where I try to 
care about them more, but otherwise I just focus on me and my 
surroundings.
[Turbulent_Cover_634]: You are smart
[Lavamites]: Same for the most part. There are certain issues where I try to 
care about them more, but otherwise I just focus on me and my 
surroundings.
[BeerandSandals]: The best advice I ever heard was “if you can’t change it, why 
worry about it?” Many problems are so large and complex that I can’t do 
anything to fix them, so I do my best to not worry about them.
Trying to fix some of these issues is like fighting gravity, you’ll always get pulled down.
It’s good to be aware of what’s going on in the world, and how it 
may impact all of us. The best you can do is control how it impacts you.
But we can change things, just not individually.
I think collective action is better than disengagement. Wecanchange our society. We just can't do it alone.
I don't think your points are mutually exclusive. As Gramsci said "Pessimism of Intellect, Optimism of will."
One shouldn't tie their emotions to things outside of their direct
 control however that isn't an excuse to be inactive in larger affairs. 
One should be prepared mentally to lose and fail however one should also
 still fight with that preparation being a necessary brace that helps 
hold them together in tough times. Basically, fight for what you believe
 in, but don't simply take victory as a forgone conclusion. Its still a 
fight and you need to be prepared to be battered and bruised and even 
lose. However you still fight in spite of that because you know that 
only by fighting is there any chance at all for positive change.

[[deleted]]: these are 2024 feelings, it’s not just a gen-z thing. A lot sucks right now.
But please don’t fantasize about cancer? Life is all about ups and
 downs. And many have lived in far more horrendous circumstances. It’s 
up to you what you focus on.
[[deleted]]: But please don’t fantasize about cancer? Life is all about ups and
 downs. And many have lived in far more horrendous circumstances. It’s 
up to you what you focus on.
[[deleted]]: A lot of these things that are causing your depression are thought
 processes happening in your head rather than actual events happening to
 you.
For example, you talk about the terror of AI. But, like, that terror is just in your head. You arecreatinga world where the worst possible outcomes are happening even though 
said things haven’t happened. I call that catastrophizing. So why should
 AI really be on the list of things causing you depression? It hasn’t 
done anything to you. You can’t let things that don’t actually do 
anything to you affect you like that. You could just as easily envision a
 world where AI is your buddy making your life better. It’s just as fake
 as the other thought process, but it’s at least more enjoyable to 
believe.
Another point I’d like to make. You asked a question. 
Specifically, you asked “what do I have to look forward to?” You then 
proceeded to not list anything that anyone would ever look forward to. 
Everything you worded afterwards I wouldn’t look forward to when someone
 writes it like that either. I promise you, nobody who views their life 
as being a cog in a machine is happy. The very way you decided to frame 
and describe it forces you down a path. And if it is framed that way, 
then you cannot be happy. I could not be happy.Nobodycan frame their worldview around something so negative and be actually 
happy participating. So stop framing it like that. Give your frame some 
damn breathing room. The way you choose to describe the world around you
 will dictate the logic of feelings following it.
Instead of listing all the things you don’t look forward to, try 
listing the things you actually look forward to. Is there a movie you 
really want to see? A game you want to complete? A girl you really want 
to talk to? A new personal record? What are your actual goals? Make an 
effort to focus on that and not the “anti goals” like you did in this 
post.
It really sucks that I had to scroll this far down to see a genuinely workable suggestion.
[Dakota820]: It really sucks that I had to scroll this far down to see a genuinely workable suggestion.
[Hosj_Karp]: This is the most peaceful and most prosperous time in human 
history. There are of course continuing challenges and its absolutely 
good to be engaged in the world and involved in making it better, but 
you absolutely should not adopt pessimistic fatalism if thatpreventsyou from doing good for yourself and the world.
You only believe the world is "going to shit" because news 
(including social media "news") only covers negative events. Negative 
news gets clicks and views. No one is clicking on an article that says 
"HIV rates down 11% from last year" or "Zimbabwe and Venezuala sign new 
peace treaty". Make sense?
For every new problem in the world facing our generation that our 
parents and grandparents didn't have to deal with, there are many that 
our grandparents and parents dealt with that no longer affect us.
[[deleted]]: Don't dwell on things you can't do anything about. Because just 
sitting around and feeling like shit all the time accomplishes nothing. 
Just get up and do something, anything.
[[deleted]]: lol i been depressed since middle school got diagnosed with mdd 
and gad medicines never work either so i stopped trying them so idk i do
 have my days where i want to just end it all but then some days are

[[deleted]]: Knowing that I, my generation, will be held accountable for the 
world I leave behind gives me a sense of purpose that actually helps 
with some of the despair. I feel like there's an awareness of our role 
as a generation that is coming to light as we begin to take the place of
 those who preceeded us.
Yes things are bad, and theyre gonna get worse. It's going to be 
up to us to pick up the pieces, and the indignance we experience must be
 coupled with the indomitable will tomakethings better, not just ask nicely.
u forgot that 60 trillion in wealth is changing hands between the 
old rich fucks and their kids. theyre going to maintain the status quo 
and wealth disparity will continue to increase unless something 
unforeseen happens
Compartmentalize and find one thing in the world that's within 
your power to make better. The fate of the world is outside of your 
control.

But with Burnout/depression
It’s gotten better than it ever was but it’s been there since I 
was 12 or younger… Kinda got use to just doing stuff anyways unless it 
got too heavy
[Zealousideal_Scene62]: You have to keep your momentum going or you collapse. The systems we live in are much the same way.
[XiMaoJingPing]: Because crying and doing nothing solves nothing. I went to 
college, got a good degree and got a good job. Sure I don't have enough 
currently to buy a house but in a couple more years I'll have enough and
 i'll be making more.
You have no choice but to become a cog in the capitalist machine, or else you’ll be homeless and unable to live
well yeh that's life...
[donotfire]: Yeah I have bipolar II. I have no girlfriend and just graduated 
college. I live with my parents because I don’t know how the fuck 
capitalism works. No job at all. Running in circles and relapsed.
I really wish I had a girlfriend though. I really want that. I’ve 
learned that the more you want it, the more repulsive you are. That’s 
the sad truth: nobody likes desperation.
I have a girlfriend and it definitely helps to have someone in the
 bullshit with you, but trust me when I say internal fulfillment is 
1000x more valuable than anything another human can give you.

[Rodgeroger]: You could write a post like this for pretty much every year of human history. Hope this helps.
[[deleted]]: I just like myself and life too much. Work sucks tho lol
[[deleted]]: I just learn to accept that the nature of the world is just 
chaotic and volatile. It doesn’t mean to be passive or endorse but to 
come to peace with the way the world is. I have no direct control of the
 world around me but what I can control is how I conduct my character 
through my morals/values and my perception. Being optimistic to me is 
just trying to be resilient to the nature of the world around me. Plus 
the world being chaotic and volatile to me is just a potential for 
learning to be resilient and improve my character.
Also I just like to connect with people.
[B_Maximus]: It sounds like what you said, too much time on the Internet
[petkoTHEVIKING]: I detach from things outside of my control and put 100% of my time and effort into the things that I can.
You'd be surprised how far you can get if you just switched off 
the doomer mindset. I sincerely think a significant portion of y'all 
aren't even that depressed (some might be. Go get diagnosed idgaf) 
...you're just lazy and the "world sucks" thing is a cope to not even 
try.
[[deleted]]: We are just built different
[kitteneatingguts]: Actually, most of the people of all ages around me are depressed. 
Many are undiagnosed, but I think they would be if they went to a 
psychiatrist. And the amount of antidepressants being sold is rising 
where I live. I'm no exception. On a bunch of meds so I can keep up with
 all this after years of trying to be cheerful and think positively. A 
chemical imbalance (which depression definitely is) in the brain and 
body is not a thing to be fixed by mantras/sports/diet, in my opinion.  I
 think depression is a reasonable response to the current state of the 
world, society and economy. I don't know any specific advice on this 
aside from meds and therapy, but I feel for you ❤
[user4489bug123]: By not being terminally online, having a healthy social life, 
working a decent job, putting in effort to getting promoted/moving up, 
having a healthy dating life, not being addicted to drugs, alcohol, 
porn, celebrity gossip or social media, having fun and engaging hobbies 
that you enjoy with your friends and having a happy optimistic friend 
group.
[Intelligent-Smile-34]: its all about perspective, i remind myself of what i actually do 
have and it makes me less depressed/ more grateful. I have a job and i 
work hard and Im able to keep a roof over head in my apartment. I have 
loved ones who love me too and care about me. its hard to do and i still
 am working on it, you got this my dude
[aybbyisok]: I disagree with almost all of those statements
[ThatGuyJosefi]: Go outside
[Classy_Shadow]: Our governments are run by walking skeletons who are out of touch with the common person
Welcome to every year in the US for the last century
Everything is expensive as shit, the economy is terrible
I got a job that actually pays my bills
Most people have to live with their parents because they can’t afford to make it on their own
Refer to previous statement
AI is slowly creeping into life and it’s actually terrifying
I’m not a doomer. The benefits far outweigh the risks. People were
 scared of electricity when it was first being used because of horrible 
things it could do. Similarly, eventually everyone moved on it became a 
normal part of life. Thats going to happen with AI. Get used to it
There’s an ongoing genocide being broadcasted live in HD and most people in power don’t really seem to care
Maybe this is just desensitization talking, but maybe you wouldn’t
 be so depressed if you would stop actively watching broadcasts of 
genocide. It’s genuinely not hard at all to not watch.
You have no choice but to become a cog in the capitalist machine, or else you’ll be homeless and unable to live
Not everyone hates their job
It’s just… how do you remain positive and hopeful in light of these sorts of things?
Get a job, find some goals, make some friends. Stop doom scrolling
 on social media all day long. Your next paragraph literally contains 
everything you need to be a functioning adult that doesn’t want to die. 
Genuinely get off the internet. I know it’s a classic response, but it’s
 just true. Get off social media and spend time with some actual people.
 You’ll notice a difference.

[DearOption5999]: It’s eventually going to get better, and I know it is. A lot of 
people in our age range, some younger, some older are in the same boat. 
They hate what the world is coming to and who’s in charge and/or going 
to be in charge. The people who ruined our lives are getting old and we 
will pick it up. A lot of young people are getting into politics and you
 can tell by their motivation that they want to actually try to fix 
things because they actually understand how we feel
[[deleted]]: Y'ever tried choccy milk?
[Ocar23]: You’re right but the solution is to organise and do something 
instead of simply talking about it on the internet, e.g joining a 
political party or union (if there is one for your workplace). That way 
we can actually achieve things, otherwise people are just going to label
 you a chronically online loser.
[duckmonke]: I was depressed for a decade, it didnt help. So I grieved my 
future and got therapy and picked up an absurdist mindset which really 
helped me take it one day at a time, focusing on expanding my mind and 
skills until things get so wild that paying rent is out of the equation 
altogether. I know things will be terrible in my 30’s and 40’s and I may
 not even make it past that (probably die by starvation or an infection,
 honestly)but I got a good couple months to a decade+ before all that. 
I’m going day by day, you never know when the time is up. Let’s enjoy 
our first world problems of today- they wont mean shit when we’re faced 
with third world (ie, real) problems.
[PockPocky]: I write a lot, and I try to check up on friends. I also like to cook. That makes me happy.
[all_about_context]: We are still on the bounce back from 2020 economically so a shitty
 time is to be expected as far as the financial crisis is concerned. 
Consumer buying power might return by the end of the decade so we have 
that to look forward to.
[[deleted]]: Disconnect from news and social media for a bit, things aren’t as bad as they seem
[TheBalzy]: Because I have two choices:
Be depressed about everything that is mostly out of my control, (or)
Do what I can, with what little I have, to make what little chance
 I can in my little slice of the world; and find a way to enjoy the 
stuff I've always enjoyed.
(Pedantic, vomit inducing naivety coming): If we don't have hope, 
then there is no hope. Without hope, people fall into apathy. There is 
still a lot worth fighting for. It's better to light a candle than to 
curse the darkness. (overly vomit inducing over)
I'm just as jaded as anyone is, but I've found after years of 
being jaded, angry and upset over things I mostly don't have any control
 over...was distracting me from actually enjoying things I do enjoy.
It's honestly a symptom of being so connected. Even though I 
understand how shitty the world is, and how shitty things are, I try not
 to let it dictate my everyday life, and I'm much happier for it. Like 
yes global warming is real, yes it's scary how excellerated it is...I 
shouldn't let that affect my enjoyment of spring walks outside listening
 to the birds.
[[deleted]]: Because I'm a massive nerd for history and statistics and see the 
patterns that our civilization follows in the modern day. I have the 
utmost confidence that things will work out in the end. I mean, I do 
great in school, I have big goals to work towards, I'm starting this 
program next year which is just going to college for the last two years 
of high-school, I was born to and live in a middle class family, I've 
worked for the last 3 or 4 years on improving my mental health and 
finding ways to cope with negative thoughts and all of that, and it's 
worked out wonderfully. I don't really have a reason to be depressed, 
sometimes I'm stressed, sometimes I just need to cry, but I'm not 
depressed and am pretty happy most of the time.
[[deleted]]: If you throw away any expectations of a just world, you'll be 
fine. I'm completely content witnessing what's going on knowing that 
that's just what people are like. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try to 
change it, though, just accept that you can't easily do anything about 
it at this very moment
[johnknockout]: You don’t create anything. You consume tv and videogames and spend
 time on Reddit.  You don’t disrupt anything. You don’t do anything in 
the material world.
You are EXACTLY why things are the way they are.
[One_Doughnut_2958]: It is what it is  I got god that’s all I need
[jimmyl_82104]: Because I ignore news, politics, and all that crap. I'm only a 
young adult once, so I spend my time having fun, I stay away from all 
that chronically online doomer bullshit.
I go outside, live my life, and have fun.
[Lucas111620]: Don’t dwell on things out of my control, morning routine (make 
bed, brush teeth, leave for work) keep in touch with my friends, light 
exercise (walking) diet (I’ve lost 18 pounds this week from sweating at 
work and reducing portion sizes)
[areeta9]: Christian Answer but:
Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have made for you declares 
the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope
 and a future.
Knowing that someone out there has control of the situation (no 
matter how bad it looks) has a plan makes it easier for me to live 
through. Not every problem in the world is mine to solve and I might not
 go down the life path or form of "success" I or anyone else imagined. 
Every fear and concern about my present and future I give to God, so 
that it's not a burden I have to carry. I also take the time to count my
 blessings, no matter how small they are, whether it be the sight of the
 tiny violets growing by the side of the road or the   fact I can 
breathe without issue. I might not get that big job I wanted, but I have
 a family that loves me. A lot of these blessings aren't guaranteed to 
us so appreciating them helps you realize how fortunate you are.
[Complete-Coyote9676]: I have friends, a roof over my head and food. Why wouldn’t I be happy ?
[[deleted]]: Trying to do stuff about it
[[deleted]]: You probably chose the worst place to ask this question. Reddit is
 an echo chamber, and this sub has some of the bleakest comments and so 
many depressed and struggling people.
Get a job, set boundaries for yourself between home life and work,
 make sure you continue to make time for your friends, family and 
hobbies.
For money purposes, watch a handful of "what to do with my money 
in my 20s" to set up ANY savings, basic investment account and start 
getting that sweet sweet compound interest going. It'll be slow at 
first, but it's all about consistency. Even 5% of your paycheck saved is
 something. Don't live outside your means.
If you're creative, keep an eye for opportunities to make some 
money on the side. See if you can scale up. Focus on learning!! Career 
or hobbies, keep your mind active.
Life really is about the small steps. If you try to plan too much,
 too grand, and worry about every problem in society, it WILL be a lot 
to handle. One baby step forward at a time.
Life might not be a breeze, but it's not as hopeless as people on this sub make it seem. You'll be fine.
[[deleted]]: I don’t think these are the reasons to be depressed.
[[deleted]]: Two reasons why.
As an average American citizen with a career, I have it better 
than 80% of people in this world. Does me little to no good to sit here 
and say my life and future are awful when there's billions of people 
throughout Asia, Africa, Latin and South America who don't even have 
consistent electricity and clean running water. In the grand scheme of 
things, I have a great life.
The world had, has, and always will have bad things in it such as 
war, etc and nothing I do will be able to stop it. Am I really going to 
continue to he depressed and jaded about my life when in America, I 
actually have the power to do something about my future? Nah. Just gotta
 keep moving.
All in all op, I get it. Life is tough and scary, but if you life 
in a first world country you likely have it better than most people on 
the planet, so it isn't that bar.
[Death-By-Lasagna]: This is just my experience but I hope you’re able to find help in 
this. I went through a major depression around the time I hit 20. Right 
when things started getting better for me, I started my first full time 
job with awful working conditions in a super dark SCIF. Then covid hit 
just a few months later and my depression kicked back in.
Fast forward to today, and (minus stress that pops up when things 
get too busy) I’m very happy. I finally was able to afford my first 
home, I’ve gotten back into lifting and running (down nearly 35 lbs), 
and have a dog that I love.
Nutrition, exercise, and discipline over time go a long way. It 
sucks for a while but that’s what I found made me happy as I got into 
good shape, felt happier, and gained freedom after living with my 
parents for so long.
Yes, not being on the internet and constantly looking at your 
phone will help, but I find taking time for the simpler things in life 
yield the best return on investment for happiness and long term health.
Oh, and make sure you’re budgeting! I keep a budget sheet that I 
update about once a month. Helps with finances and I’m doing much better
 than I ever thought I’d be at this time. Doesn’t matter if you’re 
making $20k or $100k, it helps delegate how much you can spend leisurely
 while ensuring you’re paying your bills and saving for your future.
Stay strong and hope this helps!
[fatmanstan123]: Imagine going through the great depression,  ww1 and ww2,  Spanish flu. Today's issues are tame comparatively.
[Gummie40]: All of the things you mentioned are outside our control. Don’t let the uncontrollables control you
[the_gopnik_fish]: I simply choose not to worry about these things 🤷‍♂️

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
recently turned 20(F), for a lot of my life I’ve struggled with 
depression but recently it’s really bad. I see no end in sight. I’m 
stressed all the time, everything is expensive, I’m broke. I hate my 
minimum wage job but can’t get hired anywhere else. Can’t find an 
internship anywhere, I have to watch my mom break down about bills every
 month and I can’t help her as much as I want to. People don’t believe 
in climate change which is destroying us. I’m severely burnt out and 
have no energy to do anything but sleep lately. My body hurts and I 
don’t see the future turning around. People are becoming so hateful, you
 could walk outside and be killed because you were there at the wrong 
time.
Things weren’t like this before, I’m so sad. I feel like lately 
I’ve stopped making goals for myself because I don’t see a point 
anymore. I’m having a hard time even completing one class a semester. 
Everything is catching up to me, I don’t do anything anymore but lay in 
bed. Most days I’m too tired to even pick up my phone. The days are 
going by so fast too. I’m 20 now but it seems like just last year I 
turned 16. I want to go back so bad, I feel lost.
Edit: I think what’s really not helping either is seeing my mom 
still struggling so badly at 47 years old. Everyday, she hauls herself 
up for work, she’s exhausted and her job pays her unfairly. We barely 
make ends meet for rent, living paycheck to paycheck. I know it’s up to 
me to turn my life around but it seems so unrealistic some days.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[petitecrivain]: First of all I should say I'm sorry you're going through this. 
Nobody deserves that burden. From a mental health perspective however, 
this is treatable. Depression treatment via talk therapy or medication 
can't remove life stressors but it can definitely give you tools to work
 through them. I've seen people transform in weeks or months. They went 
from bedrotting 12+ hours a day to being fully functional. I'd advise 
you to get evaluated and seek treatment.
The broader context definitely seems like a factor though. People 
seem reluctant to discuss social and economic determinants of health and
 wellness in Western countries, even as we count hundreds of thousands 
of deaths of despair. I think the issue isn't just material poverty but 
the burnout and stress inherent to working life in an era where luxuries
 are cheap, essentials are expensive, and cluttered schedules and 
technology break down social interactions, relationships, and 
solidarity. The assault on human rights and growing authoritarianism 
definitely don't help.
I can't presume to know your circumstances or opportunities but I 
can guess that someone cares about you and that you have something to 
contribute that'll make someone's day brighter. This life can be worth 
living, and there's likely a way out of your situation, even though you 
may not see it.
[zehahun]: hai diva, I get how you feel life right now is really hard. 
everything feels heavy, expensive, and unfair, and it’s easy to lose 
hope when you’re doing your best but nothing seems to work out 
especially when someone out there who didn't even struggle much and 
already has a extravagant lifestyle. you’re not weak for feeling tired 
or unmotivated, it just means you’ve been strong for too long, it's 
normal to feel like this, give your body some rest bby <3.
it’s okay to rest, cry, and not have everything figured out. you 
don’t need to have your whole future planned, you're still young AND yet
 to enjoy your 20s.
things will change, even when it doesn’t feel like they will. 
you’ve made it through every bad day so far, and that takes real 
strength that makes you a strong baddie. you’re still here, and that 
matters. try engaging yourself into a hobby whenever the thoughts are 
being mean to you.
you got this love, don't give up yet. im rooting for you. 🥹🫶🏻💕
This means a lot to me. Sometimes when I’m so in my head, it seems
 like nothing anyone says to me can make me feel better but this does. 
Thank you!
im glad it made you feel better! like I said, I'll always root for
 you, doesn't matter whether I'm next to you or not, my prayers are with
 you. think of me as a younger sister who you've to become a role model 
for, hustle in life and get that bag you deserve. whenever you feel 
suffocated, sit down and relax you're being too harsh on yourself for 
someone who just turned 20. I know you've responsibilities but without a
 healthy body and mind you won't be able to handle those 
responsibilities. you're a strong woman and an amazing sister. I love 
you. 💕

[[deleted]]: The way to end depression is to stop "socializing" online and make
 at least one close friend in real life. Someone you can share these 
things with. I know that may not be easy, but it's pretty much the only 
way out.
Nah deadass like I’ve been getting out doing more activities + 
being more social in the last few months than I ever have in my life. 
Still aware of what’s going on, but it’s not the only thing I’m focusing
 on now. Gotta show yourself it’s still good and joy out there in 
whatever you choose
I mean… easier said than done when you barely have the energy to shower, let alone socialize.

[inhaledpie4]: You sound very burnt out. Do you have friends that can support 
you, take you out for coffee, or something? I am an introvert but I 
can't overstate the importance of finding at least one person who fills 
your cup when you see them in person, meeting with them at least twice a
 month if you can (optimally once a week).
Two acts of self care and doing at least one thing a day for enjoyment (it helps if it's fun) has helped me immensely.
I think I’ve been burnt out for a few years. And as for friends, I
 do, actually. My best friend, I love her. She’s away at college. She 
lives on campus a few hours away, so we only see each other once every 
few months. I saw her last weekend, actually which helped but I don’t 
know. We talk about these things often, and I love her to death but she 
comes from a very well off family. We don’t really come from the same 
world and I have no resentment towards her about it whatsoever but she 
doesn’t know how to respond to these things sometimes. I feel a bit more
 comfortable talking to people who know what it’s like even if it’s on 
here.
Sometimes having people and friends around you doesn't necessarily
 mean you have to share about struggles, it can be a chance to feel free
 from certain troubles

[Overthinking_babes]: This is so relatable it hurts lol
[Cosmic_alien20]: Honestly it's the same everywhere. In my country, unemployment is a
 big thing with skyrocketing real estate prices. Everything is expensive
 nowadays, the negativity everywhere from news online to real life; 
sometimes I also wonder, "did all of us young generation people deserve 
this?"
But hey, only we can change our life. Tune in for new hobbies and 
new skills, and stop caring about what society thinks. I also read 
philosophy book from time to time and they have helped me quite a lot.
I hear you. I’ve been trying to pick up a hobby but I lose 
motivation so easily, I always drop it after a few months. I’m so 
disappointed in myself but I literally have lost interest in everything I
 used to love. It’s weird, I hope I get that back soon
That's because of a digital pacifier that is more appealing. Have you considered deleting social media?

[DrDrago-4]: I just learned this strategy the last few weeks, so I cant vouch really strongly
but so far I've had success, just saying fuck you to social 
anxiety. see a cool guy I want to talk to doing something I enjoy like 
disc golf ? ask to join the group
see a cute girl ? shoot that shot.
miss the homies? call em after work hours, theyre tired. youre tired. but talking is easy
its reached the point for me, the worst case scenario is doing 
nothing. honestly cant fuck up worse so, throwing darts.. why not ig
not even 22 but I see the appeal now, of like not this. idk so far
 most of my age range feels the same, we are all fucked and everyone's 
just been like not even thinking about it.
started when I made a Minecraft server for my homies, we played a 
few hours each weekend. now we talk 2hrs+ each night even if we aren't 
gaming. ive expanded that attitude, yk nothing will come to you unless 
you make it happen. time will tell, but im meeting new people again and 
its working so far
and as far as goals go, meh well. live your best life with what 
you got. might suck but try and enjoy the suck, put some effort into 
changing it. cant do 100% in a day, its the small shit that stacks up. 
sounds like self-help propaganda but that ones real, just try and be 1% 
better at xyz each day. itll happen before you know it
[Fuzea]: I just keep pushing and trying to be better than I was last year. I
 set measurable, realistic goals for myself. I exercise every day. I 
take a lot of risks with the understanding that failure is not the end 
of the world, as long as I’m alive I can always keep trying.
We only get one life. I don’t think there’s anything waiting for 
us after death, this is it, this is all we get. Might as well make the 
most of it.
You say you can barely do one class a semester, fuck it, push 
yourself and do two. If you fail at least you tried. Take another two 
and try again. A little resilience will take you very far. You should be
 more afraid of regret than of failure.

[SirThinkAllThings]: Counseling, and perhaps a psychiatrist follow up.  Sounds like you
 may have depression, but meds such as setraline and talk therapy or 
cognitive therapy may help alongside.  Prayers your way.
[Sea_Nautilus]: I feel the same as you much of the time. I think the fear from 
Covid and the political climate in the world right now is contributing 
to this.
I think there was a study done that showed that money does 
increase happiness up to the point where people were secure and weren’t 
actively worrying about finances. After that, larger amounts of money do
 not increase happiness.
I believe our governments have a responsibility to ensure every 
person is “secure” in that they are not worrying every day about 
surviving. That means some combination of livable wages, free 
healthcare, free education, subsidized housing, etc. We probably don’t 
need so many “handouts” if we just have livable wages.
Since you personally can’t really do anything about that, I think the next best solution is community.
Never in history has a 20 year old or even a 47 year old been 
expected to support themselves or anyone else on their own. Yet for some
 reason it’s expected in modern times.
Building a community means you pool resources. You provide and 
accept help. If your car breaks down, a friend drives you to your 
doctors’ appointment, and you can carpool to work with a coworker. You 
can’t afford new furniture, but you can offer to take your neighbors’ 
old couch off their hands. If you can’t afford rent, maybe you have 
someone who would let you crash on their couch.
Community is about safety. When you have people you can rely on, 
it gives you the safety net that you cannot achieve through wages alone.
Building a community in these days is becoming harder and harder. I
 don’t know the specifics about your life, so it’s hard to give real 
advice, but you could even try asking ChatGPT: “How can I build a 
community around me and my mom to help us feel more secure when times 
are difficult? Ask me any questions that could help you provide advice.”
General advice is to just be more aware of the people in your 
life, especially the ones who may be more open to company. Many places 
have meetup groups for this purpose. You can start there and see what 
you think. It’s easiest to make friends with people you see often, so 
finding free classes (check your local library for things like this!) or
 volunteering somewhere (just for an hour a week or something) could be a
 place to start and a convenient way to find people with similar 
interests.  As an example, joining a dungeons and dragons group (can be 
virtual) is a way to ensure you spend time with the same people on a 
regular basis, and it’s a quick way to bond quickly with people.

[Notequal_exe]: I've been writing my second book lately for fun. I also had some 
really nice tutoring sessions with my students. Made my day to see them 
light up at the custom math problems I made for their fields. I gotta 
move back in with my family from the rents since I haven't been able to 
get a higher paying job for months. I guess I'd say sheer luck, lots of 
praying, holding on to friends and family, and appreciating the little 
things.

[Libitatu]: Is it that bad in US?
[TinyHovercraft7244]: hey. it is nice to know other people are feeling the same way and 
having similar experiences. you said that it’s up to you to turn things 
around. but it’s not. nor is it your fault that things are the way they 
are right now. that’s the problem with our economic order. it’s all 
about the individual and it’s their fault if they don’t win in a system 
where it’s impossible to win. the best thing you can do is realize this 
and let yourself take a break from the mental stress of trying to change
 everything yourself. build community and try to focus on building a 
strong internal and spiritual life. everything else is bs & will 
never work in a system that is designed to fuck us over
[Particular-Song2587]: Might sound crazy but sometimes you have to migrate for a shot at a better life.
I have been thinking about moving out of the country (🇺🇸) for a

make it a goal to save as much as ai can and move for my late 20’s

[Special_EDy]: Your mom probably isnt a healthy person for you to be living with.
 It sounds like she has depression and anxiety issues, which you would 
be genetically prone to inherit those tendencies, and her mood is 
affecting you. Im not saying anything else about either of yall, or that
 theres anything wrong with what either of yall are going through, just 
that "misery loves company". If you are mentally struggling, the worst 
thing you can do is surround yourself with people who reinforce that 
mindset.
As for having a bleak outlook, that is entirely within your 
control even though I hear you feel powerless against the machine of 
politics and economics. These are things which are affecting you 
mentally, and that mental anguish is affecting your physical health, but
 none of these things have any direct impact on your well-being besides 
making you depressed.
Climate change isnt something worth losing sleep over, its not 
something that will happen in our lifetimes. I dont think there's 
actually anyone who thinks that it is good to be pumping exhaust fumes 
and other wastes into the atmosphere. However, it's not like your life 
has been directly impacted by climate change, or ever will be. The time 
it takes coastlines to move or environments to shift will take 
generations, cities will move and life will adapt. We've survived 
asteroids, ice ages, oxygen levels so high they nearly sterilized the 
planet, etc. Im not trying to make a case that you shouldn't be 
concerned or that we shouldn't take steps to mitigate climate change, I 
just want to make it clear that it would be unhealthy for you to let 
this negativity impact your life by getting depressed.
There are lots of nice people in the world. Even more importance 
than how we treat each other, is how you feel about it. If I am in a bad
 mood, depressed or anxious, Im going to have a bad day and other people
 are going to make it worse. If I am feeling good and having a great 
day, those same people and same interactions are going to make my day 
better. The world just sort of is what it is, and its up to you to 
decide if thats good or bad. You will see the world the way you want to 
see it, and not being in the right headspace is going to make it 
disastrous.

TÍTULO: HOW TO CURE DEPRESSION GUIDE : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
(INTRO)
I'm someone who used to have EXTREME depression. I hated being 
alive. I played video games from 10-12 hours a day (Not an 
exaggeration), had no real friends, was out of shape (fat, no muscle). 
The list goes on.
Worst of all - I had no hope for the future
The mindset you need to adopt to cure depression is this:
"Your life isn't bad because you're depressed, your depressed because your life is bad".
Some people think depression is a medical condition. Maybe it is, 
but following my guide will still make you happier anyway. So you have 
no excuses not to follow it, if you truly want to be happy.
(PRACTICAL STEPS TO CURE DEPRESSION)
Adopt the mentality that you are accountable for all the problems 
in your life, giving you the mental strength to overcome and fix them.
Don't blame anyone else. They aren't going to fix your life for you.
2. Start exercising regularly, ideally 5+ times per week (gym, sports, martial arts etc.)
3. Read books for atleast 30 minutes a day
4.Get on top of your work (studies, job, business etc.)
5. Meditate for 5-15 minutes a day to slowly clear your mind of distractions (starts off hard)
6. Improve your social skills and get more friends, and better relationships with your current friends and family
7. Limit phone, social media and video game usage to as low as possible, ideally less than 30 minutes per day
8. Become disinterested in politics and other aspects of life that you cannot change.
If you can't change them and thinking about them makes you stressed, then why think about them?
(EXTRA NOTES)
The general theme here is that improving your life will give you a
 feeling of hope - knowing each day is slightly better than the last. 
How can you not be happy?
It will probably take you a few months to see any significant improvements in your life.
There will be ups and downs on your journey to cure depression

[SquintonPlaysRoblox]: This is all fair. Just remember - depression can be an illness, 
but it can also be a symptom. Depression has a lot of different causes, 
and can manifest in a lot of different ways. Because of this, there 
isn’t a solution that 100% works for everyone. For example, I have 
depression because of a chemical imbalance, which I take medicine for. I
 have been depressed for other reasons, which required different 
solutions. Don’t get demoralized just because a solution doesn’t work! 
Not all of them will work for you. However, these are my suggestions.
Establish a good sleep schedule. Being well rested really helps.
Eat well and exercise. You don’t need to be in crazy shape, you 
don’t need to watch every calorie - but taking care of your body goes a 
long way.
Get out there and do stuff with people. Either do things with 
friends, or go join a social club and try to make some friends. (I 
wouldn’t recommend using any romantic relationship or sex stuff for this
 - depression is good at clouding your judgement, and it’s really hard 
to be there for someone when your struggling to be there for yourself.)
Find something to fill your time with. Pick up a new hobby or expand on something you already enjoy.
Consult with your doctor! Even if you aren’t interested in 
medication for depression, depression can be caused by other stuff going
 on in your body like hormone imbalances and thyroid issues. Medicine 
like an SSRI might be the solution for you, or it might not be.
Depressions whole thing, the main reason why it’s a problem, is 
that you can’t just wave it off. If you want to end your depression, you
 have to work against it. Depression tends to be self-perpetuating in 
that it causes you to withdraw, not take care of yourself, and generally
 struggle to interact with life, which causes you to become more 
depressed. It’s hard to beat depression, but it’s doable and worth 
doing! Don’t be afraid to ask for help and lean on the people who care 
about you.

government or politics. So I understand the feelings all too well
That being said, I’ve found it’s important to find joy in these 
times. Focus on your hobbies, your interests, and just be mindful of 
making time for yourself.
As far as what you can do - continue to research, continue to 
educate, but don’t doom scroll. Focus on community around you, because 
at the end of the day, the human race and every society has survived

I agree with you.
A lot of people are in a path of trauma, pain, and destruction. 
Even if it “sort itself out”, it won’t be without a lot of pain.
There are certainly things that can be done differently too. 
Taking small actions like being mindful of spending at businesses, 
creating a better community, and continuing to educate yourself are all 
ways to take tangible, positive action for oneself in times of darkness.

[Reddit03012004]: You need to stop putting your emotions in the hands of people you

you know what you can’t control how you react to it. You might not like 
what Trump and Elon Musk are doing, but complaining and constantly 
worrying about it isn’t gonna change it. The only thing you can control 
is your attitude and how you react to things, so my advice would be to 
stop watching the news and disconnect from anything political, whether 
on social media or in real life.

person who just gets anxious if things are happening around them? I feel
 like there are a lot of people who just get addicted to being axious

reaction.

media news cycle.

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I just finished reading a book called 'Stolen Focus' by Johann 
Hari, about the various ways modern life makes it difficult for us to 
focus. Apart from social media manipulation, poor diet, and poor sleep, 
he identifies the way children have been raised since the 1990s (meaning
 the dawn of Gen Z) as something that increases anxiety and erodes 
focus.
Here are a few excerpts I found interesting:
"A few years ago I was sitting drinking coffee at sunset in a 
small village at the edge of a forest in Cauca, in the south-west of 
Colombia. A few thousand people live here, growing the caffeinated 
drinks we glug globally to keep ourselves alert. I watched them as we 
slowly unwound for the day.The adults had put tables and chairs out on 
the street, and they were chatting in the shadow of a lush green 
mountain. I looked on as they wandered from table to table, when I 
noticed something I rarely see in the Western World anymore. All across 
the village, children were playing freely, without adults watching over 
them. Some had a hoop they were rolling along the ground in a group. 
Some were chasing each other around the edge of the forest, and daring 
each other to run, only to dash out again thirty seconds later, 
shrieking and laughing. Even very small children-- they seemed to be 
three or four-- were running around just with other kids to look out for
 them. Occasionally one of them would fall and run back to their mother.
 The rest only returned home when their parents called them at eight in 
the evening, and the streets would finally empty."
"It occurred to me that this is what childhood looked like for my 
parents, in very different places-- an Alpine Swiss village, and a 
working-class Scottish tenement. They ran around freely without their 
parents for most of the day from when they were quite small, and only 
returned to eat and sleep. This is, in fact, what childhood looked like 
for all of my ancestors, so far as I can tell, going back thousands of 
years. There are periods some children didn't live like this, when they 
were forced to work in factories, for example, or the living nightmare 
of chattel slavery-- but in the long human history these are extreme 
exceptions."

"Today, I don't know any children who live like that. In the past 
thirty years there have been huge changes in childhood. By 2003, in the 
US only 10 percent of children spent any time playing freely outdoors on
 a regular basis. Childhood now happens, overwhelmingly, behind closed 
doors, and when they do get to play, they are supervised by grown-ups, 
or it takes place on screens. The way children spend their time at 
school has also changed dramatically. The school systems in the US and 
Britain have been redesigned by politicians so that teachers are forced 
to spend the majority of their time preparing and drilling children for 
tests. In the US, only 73 % of elementary schools  have any form of 
recess. Free play and enquiry have fallen off a cliff."
"In the 1960s, in a suburb of Chicago, a five-year-old girl walked
 out of her house, alone. It was a fifteen minute walk to Lenore's 
school, and every day she did it by herself. When she got to the road 
near school, she was helped to cross safely by another child, a 
ten-year-old boy wearing a yellow sash across his chest, whose job was 
to stop the cars and shepherd the smaller kids across the tarmac. At the
 end of each school day, Lenore would walk out of the gates, again 
without an adult, and she would wander the neighbourhood with her 
friends, or try to spot four-leaf-clovers, which she collected. There 
was often a kickball game which started spontaneously, and sometimes she
 would join in. By the time she was nine years old, when she felt like 
it, she would get on her bike and ride a few miles to the library to 
pick out books, and then curl up reading them somewhere quiet. At other 
times, she'd knock on her friends' doors to see if they wanted to play. 
If Joel was home, they'd play Batman, and if Betsy was home, the would 
play The Princess and The Witch. Lenore always insisted on being the 
Witch. Finally, when she was hungry or it started to get dark, she went 
home."
"To many of us, this scene now seems jarring, or even shocking. 
Across the US over the past decade, there have been many instances where
 people have seen children as old as nine walking unaccompanied in the 
street an they've called the police to report it as a case of parental 
negligence. But in the 1960s, this was the norm all over the world. 
Almost all children's lives looked something like this. Being a kid 
meant you went out into your neighbourhood and you wandered around, 
found other kids, and made up your own games. Adults had only a vague 
idea where you were. A parent who kept their child indoors all the time,
 or walked them to school, or stood over them while they played, and 
intervened in their games, would have been regarded as crazy."
"By the time Lenore had grown up and had her own children, in New 
York City in the 1990s, everything had changed. She was expected to walk
 her own children to school and wait while they went through the gates, 
and then pick them up at the end of the dat. Nobody let their kids play 
unsupervised, ever. Children stayed in the home all the time, unless 
there was an adult to watch over them..."

"Lenore suspected the is a way this is harming kids.... She 
started to seek out the leading scientists who have studied these 
questions....They taugh her that when children play they learn their 
most important lessons--the ones they use for the rest of their life."
"Picture again that scene on Lenore's street as a child in 
Chicago, or what I saw in Colombia. What skills are kids learning there,
 as they play freely with each other? For starters, if you're a kid and 
you're on your own with other kids, 'You figure out how to make 
something happen,' Lenore says. You must use your creativity to create a
 game. You must then convince other children that your game is the best 
to play. Then 'you figure out how to read people enough so that the game
 keeps going.'. You have to learn to negotiate when it's your turn and 
when it's their turn-- so you have to learn about other people's needs 
and desires, and how to meet them. You learn how to cope with being 
disappointed, or frustrated. You learn all this 'through  being 
excluded, through coming up with a new game, through getting lost, 
through climbing the tree, and then somebody says, "Climb higher!" and 
you can't decide if you will or you won't.Then you do, an it's 
exhillirating, and then you climb a little higher the next time-- or you
 climb a little higher and it's so scary that you cry... And yet: now 
you're on top. These are all crucial forms of attention."
"One of Lenore's intellectual mentors, Dr Isabel Behncke, told me 
that the scientific evidence so far says that 'there are three main 
areas of child development where free-play has a major impact.'"
"'One is creativity and imagination--it is how you learn to think 
about problems and solve them. The second is 'social bonds'--its how you
 learn to interact with other people and socialize. And the third is 
'aliveness' it's how you learn to experience joy and pleasure. What is 
learned during play is not a trivial add-on to becoming a functioning 
human being, it is the core of it. To be a person who can pay attention 
fully, you need a base of free-play."

"But suddenly we have been taking this out of kid's lives. Today 
when kids do get to play, it is mainly under adult supervision, who set 
rules and tell them what to do.  On lenore's street when she was a kid, 
everyone played softball and policed the rules themselves. Today, they 
go to organized activities where adults intervene all the time and to 
tell them what the rules are. Free play has turned into supervised play,
 and so-- like processed food--has been drained of most of its value."
"This means that now, as a kid, Lenore said, 'you're not getting 
that chance to develop these skills--because you're in a car being 
driven to a game where somebody tells you what position you're playing, 
and when to catch the ball, and when it's your time to hit, and who's 
bringing the snack, and you can't bring grapes because they have to be 
cut into quarters and it's your mom's job to do that... That's a very 
different childhood, because you haven't experienced the give-and-take 
of life that's going to prepare you for adulthood.' As a result, kids 
are not having the problems and exhilaration of getting there on their 
own. One day, Barbara Sarnecka, an associate professor of cognitive 
sciences at the University of California, told lenore that today 'adults
 are saying: 'Here's the environment. I've already mapped it. Stop 
exploring" But that's the opposite of what childhood is.'"

[Substantial_Bet5764]: Bro good luck trying to get you kids to even play outside I have 
plenty of nephews and nieces all in gen Z that just don’t know how to 
play outside… it’s so weird lol
I asked one of my nephews what his favorite sport was and he said fuckin Netflix… Like whhhhhhat? Lol
[[deleted]]: I think this could also have a little bit to do with how Gen X 
(which are mostly the parents of Gen Z) grew up. They’re often called 
the “latchkey” generation because they grew up in a particular time of 
the 70s and 80s where women were joining the workforce en masse, despite
 child care being generally expensive and inaccessible. As a result, 
many “latchkeys” grew up alone at home or watching their younger 
siblings. I think there’s a chance this could’ve played into how some 
Gen Xers raised their Gen Z children, being very protective and 
“present” in their lives.
Yep. Overcompensating
[Global_Perspective_3]: Yep. Overcompensating
[LacrosseKid8]: Growing up constantly in school or at a day care place when your 
day is entirely scheduled i found that when i had free time it was 
pretty anxiety provoking and i found it difficult to try different 
things
Just getting us conditioned to work our lives away

[PaleontologistTrue74]: When the environment changed to a more hostile space, adult/parent
 supervisors are required. We know the police wont do anything but 
atleast mom would run up to protect the children.
The little eleanor lived in a suburb. If you change that locations
 to the heroine infested ghettos, I dont think that child would have the
 same experience. The bike she drove to library would be stolen, the 
crosswalk guard would be nonexistant, the school yard would be needle 
infested. And the kickball game would turn into a shootout.
The columbian village is a odd portrait that left me questioning.
Do these kids go to school?
Do these kids have field jobs instead of schooling like with the cocoa harvesting industry who employees child labor?
What cartel runs this area?
As for the swiss and Ireland, I would have enjoyed more  information.
The anxiety and depression problem is a hydra with many heads. 
This is one of them, I cannot discredit it. Yet at the same time theres 
9,000 more heads causing the issue.
This overprotection shit happens even in some of the safest 
neighborhoods in the western world nowadyas. Parents since the 2000s 
have been overly paranoid over their kids being kidnapped or God forbid 
falling off a tree and getting a booboo on their knee
Actually it’s been that way since the 1990’s.
If the neighborhood isnt gated. It ain't safe.
Even if it is gated it still isn't safe enough for most parents nowadays
Idk but I see what you mean.
This has some truth in it. Even me as a 94 born had a pretty 
protective childhood. I want to say ever since started kindergarten in 
90s. We couldn't really  play outside, unless it was with our cosuisn 
but that so rare itself. I wasn't allowed to have friends, well i could 
but I couldn't go to their house. I remember asking could I go over my 
friend house at 7 and they said no. My dad would pick me up from school 
so I never even walked home and you would think when I got in high 
school jt would be better? No it was worse. They feared I would get 
jumped on or get in some fights so basically they picked me up from 
school and back even though i wanted to catch a bus sometimes. So 
basically my childhood was just playing videos games with my brother or 
by myself,, watching TV.  The  Crazy thing is my older siblings said 
they used to be outside all the time and my oldest sister would just 
walk to her cousin house to the store when she was like 10. I could not 
do any of that. I thought I just had protective parents but know that 
stuff on here maybe its a correlation as to why they did that other than
 just be protective parents.
Damn, that fucking sucks for you. I know how this shit feels. Having to live under similarly overprotective parents myself
What even happened with your parents to have them act this way with you anyway?
Im not sure honestly. They were just very protective as time went 
on. I know my oldest sister born 84 had a lot more freedom but they were
 pretty protective of all  of us.  My siblings tell people all the time 
once the we moved to the house (which happened to be the summer of 99 
when I started kindergarten) that we couldn’t go outside. But they 
remember when we were outside playing all the time, it’s like I sort of 
remember but not as much since I was bit younger. I’m not sure why they 
were this way but it’s the news. I do know overall things started to get
 worse like crime and stuff in the 2000s. It’s even worse with all of 
the shootings ( I live in the US).

[[deleted]]: I and all of my peers got to experience the "free range" 
childhood. I was outside for a huge part of the day and went to school 
independently since I was like 7 and gradually upgraded the route and 
distance. Also did some remarkably stupid shit like making explosives 
and exploring abandoned buildings but the adults didn't need to know.
Kids nowadays are still mostly free range but there are some 
worrying signs of helicopter parenting and the "my kid is a literal 
angel" mentality.
Idk this is all anecdotal. Maybe we're going the way of helicopter parenting, but it's not here yet. Born 2000, Slovenia.
That bit about living inslovenia is key. What is described here is mostly about living in western europe and america.
[CoverYourself-inOil]: That bit about living inslovenia is key. What is described here is mostly about living in western europe and america.
[WaveofHope34]: seems more like a US thing parents in my country werent over 
protective at all back then when i was a kid but they for sure are now. 
Kid fall on their face they rush to them like there life depends on it 
meanwhile when i was kid my parents just said its just a scratch dont 
cry about it lol.
[[deleted]]: Idk maybe
[[deleted]]: My childhood used to be overprotective since birth , in 7 years 
later , it decreased due to conflicts with my family. I’m still living 
on today. I’m autistic. My focus was off balance. My parents let me 
explore the physical and digital world but in caution.
[[deleted]]: Not so much of over protections but the lack of giving us a chance to do our things perhaps.
[Revolutionary-Oil568]: I don’t know where you live, but people in my city be playing 
outside. I Seek is outside all the time. I’m surprised people’s kids 
don’t be outside.. personally, I’m someone who stays in doors, unless I 
go out somewhere.
[Square-Bee-844]: It’s even worse when you have immigrant parents/guardians.

TÍTULO: It is NOT too late for you. If you are depressed with 0 friends, become someone you like. : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I have had 0 friends. I know people who had no friends a year ago. You gotta understand something:
No one wants to be your friend if you're always fucking negative. The negative emotionsthemselvesare killing you. It's physically unhealthy to be so upset all the time,
 but it is fixable. You need to become a person you like being around, 
that's what makes other people attracted to you. Your smiles will be 
forced, and you will be awkward. That's because you're not good at being
 happy or likeable yet. Just imagine in five years, you could have so 
many friends that when some other poor fuck comes up to you and 
awkwardly tries to force a friendship that you will feel the same way 
toward them: pity and discomfort.
It's sad to see young people go through it. I been through it, so I
 know how it is. What's even worse is to be 45 with 0 friends, 0 bitches
 (male or female), 0 interests outside drinking/smoking your problems 
away, and always talking about how unfair life is.
Get your skin clear. Take care of your oral hygiene. Look at 
clothes and decide what style you like. Find a band or comedian you 
love. Getreallygood at something. Exercise and eat the right 
amount of food to gain/lose weight. Go (back) to school for what you 
want to do. Learn how to deal with anxiety as a physical symptom.
Foster competence, not confidence. Don't tell yourself you should like yourself. Make yourself that motherfucking guy.
Become who you really are.
Edit: Seems to be some confusion about the 'poor fuck' comment. 
I'll assume my point wasn't clear and I needed to phrase it better. The 
point isn't to become apathetic to other people's suffering -- it's that
 when you're in it you feel like the weirdo. When you got your own thing
 going on, you see exactly why (even if you were that weirdo before) 
people don't want to be around thise types of people. When you got your 
own thing going on, other people can tell and like to be around those 
kinds of people. When you're so available that they're your only friend,
 it forces people into an awkward situation when you need that for your 
social interaction, and they genuinely are just tryna live their life. 
If you had a good life, you're not gonna dive headfirst into someone 
else's problems to solve them. People want other people who are like 
them, they don't want friends out of pity. Sorry for the confusion.
Second edit: For half yall commenting that you have already 
improved everything and still have no friends: this post was for you. 
You lack self-awareness. You're defensive, depressive, and not fun to be
 around. If you don't want to be told what your problem is, you're not 
gonna get better.
Genuinely wishing the best for you all. Going to my friends for 
dinner so I prolly won't even open Reddit for a few days. I would try 
that yourselves.

[soohanabi]: That's very sweet and I'm happy you're able to find solace and 
trust in someone else that way! I'm not sure if you yourself are a 
woman, but I am, and I'm speaking from a place of my own experiences 
whereby men consistently disappoint, betray and abuse me. I don't think 
there's any value for me at least, and most women, to find their 
salvation in men. As we all know by now, being a woman is already a 
safety risk in and of itself. I think women need to be whole before 
looking for a romantic partner because it will help us know what to and 
not to settle for.
(Not directed at you, but yes this applies to all genders but I am
 not omnigendered so can the "what about me" crowd please fuck off)
[soohanabi]: I mean I literally said romance is NOT a supplement for platonic 
relationships in my original comment. So you're repeating my own point 
back to me, really. But yeah I mean I agree. We're saying the same 
thing. Not trying to be rude. Also, I said having a partner is the 
'cherry atop a full cake'. Yeah the 'full cake' is having hobbies, 
friends, familial connections, work, etc. So.
[Hubris1998]: Yeah I'm sure women are into needy men with 0 friends

friends, but a SO shouldn't replace all of them.  It puts a huge burden

shouldn't need friends either when they do.

 toughened up.

I feel you man, I had social anxiety plagued my life for years but
 I had to work on myself internally to get rid of it. I did self 
acceptance affirmations, meditation and working on clearing my traumas 
to get rid of SA.
If we always treat it like a disorder and act like a victim, we 
will never lead a more happier life. The thought of just avoiding people
 my whole life while missing out on so many things motivated me. It’s 
hard man to comfortably overcome SA, I know it deeply but it’s 
absolutely doable.
Sorry, but that is such an ignorant take. It is a whole lot 
different thing to just be a lil awkward and anxious than the mental 
illness that is an anxiety disorder.
Stop with the bullshit narrative of “I did it, you dumb/lazy if 
you also can’t”. Specially if you have such a shallow insight on what 
mental illnesses is
I suffered from agoraphobia, body dysmorphia, and anxiety panic 
disorder all my life. It took me several years to overcome it through 
therapy and other various methods.
Nothing is easy and it sucks, but you know what sucks harder? 
Succumbing to victim mentality and not willing to try to overcome it 
because it is a mental disorder/illness.

 lays it out. It’s a shallow insight on what mental illness is
by definition those people don’t have the depth to contain a good understanding of it, lost causes
'if we always treat it like a disorder'
my friend what the hell else are we supposed to treat it like. did
 you have like minor anxiety, or did you have a social anxiety disorder?
because idk what the he'll else you're supposed to treat a disorder like
I prefer a world where people won’t bully/harshly judge you for seeming anxious,
then some could more easily treat it through exposure therapy and 
yes some could have full remission but guess what kids like you don’t 
like to admit?
Some won’t have full remission. Some still will seem anxious even 
if they’re having a good day, and won’t deserve to be bullied or tough 
loved by anyone for how they come across on a shallow surface level.
I got pretty bad chronic depression and my advice is that you 
gotta fight it like hell to get out of it. it doesnt mean being 
relentlessly positive or super hard on yourself, though. you do have to 
start putting the work in though, cuz nobody is gonna do it for you.
Some of you guys won't change even if y'all see the writing on the wall and that's why you guys are the way you are.
It’s a loser mentality and this subreddit is in love with it

yes some could have full remission but guess what kids like you don’t 
like to admit?
Some won’t have full remission. Some still will seem anxious even 
if they’re having a good day, and won’t deserve to be bullied or tough 
loved by anyone for how they come across on a shallow surface level.
[Eltipo25]: Sorry, but that is such an ignorant take. It is a whole lot 
different thing to just be a lil awkward and anxious than the mental 
illness that is an anxiety disorder.
Stop with the bullshit narrative of “I did it, you dumb/lazy if 
you also can’t”. Specially if you have such a shallow insight on what 
mental illnesses is
I suffered from agoraphobia, body dysmorphia, and anxiety panic 
disorder all my life. It took me several years to overcome it through 
therapy and other various methods.
Nothing is easy and it sucks, but you know what sucks harder? 
Succumbing to victim mentality and not willing to try to overcome it 
because it is a mental disorder/illness.
Sorry to necro a nice person, but thank you for the last line that
 lays it out. It’s a shallow insight on what mental illness is
by definition those people don’t have the depth to contain a good understanding of it, lost causes

[Spacellama117]: 'if we always treat it like a disorder'
my friend what the hell else are we supposed to treat it like. did
 you have like minor anxiety, or did you have a social anxiety disorder?
because idk what the he'll else you're supposed to treat a disorder like

[farshnikord]: I got pretty bad chronic depression and my advice is that you 
gotta fight it like hell to get out of it. it doesnt mean being 
relentlessly positive or super hard on yourself, though. you do have to 
start putting the work in though, cuz nobody is gonna do it for you.
[mrdime012]: Some of you guys won't change even if y'all see the writing on the wall and that's why you guys are the way you are.

Yeah, insults that'll work.
[CollegeBoy1613]: Yeah, insults that'll work.
[ghostscrolls]: or and hear me out here just give up and i dont mean that in the 
give up and wallow in a pit of dispair sense i mean give up trying to 
impress others and have em like you i found myself to be much happier 
once i stopped giving a shit abt friends and gave up on trying to get 
people to like me i have like 3 people id rlly call close and ones my bf
 lmao
this is the way, you'll attract people you like and keep people you don't like away (for the most part)
Honestly this is what I did, and it’s kinda what OP is saying but it just the other side of the same coin.
The coin is “you have to be there for you at least”
I gave up so fucking long ago I tried to be myself you know where that got me? Depressed 0 friends 0 future

[DemolitionMatter]: Platitudes everywhere
[MarauderSlayer44]: -starts with “You need to be someone you like…..”-ends with “become who you really are”.Yup, another one ofthoseposts. Downvoted just for hypocrisy.ETA-
 forgot the most important point. If I have to grind my real personality
 into dust just to be acceptable, those aren’t people who are worth my 
time, let alone my time being dedicated to THAT. I’d rather literally 
work on accepting being alone and isolated for the rest of my life. 
That’s how fucking sick y’all sound to me when you say this. I’d rather 
just stay alone, or just uhhh, “leave”.
people trying to justify their negativity in the comments like 
this is more inspiring than the original post - i’m like damn i really 
don’t want to end up like that
You realize everyone changes? You will change rather you like it 
or not. It's part of life. I think op is trying to day its better to 
nudge that change in the positive direction, rather than the negative.

[Yungjak2]: A LOT of people need to actually read this. I get society in

I think most people here realize this but are in 2 separate camps.

for the better.

[[deleted]]: I’m good
[edgygothteen69]: Yeah ok bro. I check all the boxes you mentioned and still no 
bitches or friends. I guess my smile doesn't have enough teeth which is 
why I don't just randomly make friends all the time.
"oh then it must be your fault you're probably a bad person"
Fuck outa here. Shit is more complex than just "get your life in 
order." plenty of people who don't check all the "life" boxes have 
friends and lovers. Others check all the boxes (job, money, smarts, 
body, hobbies) and don't have any kind of social life. Maybe they're 
just awkward. Maybe they have a fucked up headspace from years of 
isolation. Maybe they don't have opportunities to really meet people.
The fact is, getting your life in order will not get you friends. 
They are completely unrelated. Your entire premise is wrong.
This is a very sobering comment that I wish was higher.
Truth is I wish I could just become more attractive and adapt my 
personality to be liked by others. It really isn't that simple.
At the very least we need to stop conflating good and liked. Some of the worst people are popular.

[UnderstandingOdd8014]: I did this. Guess what? You will get some nice artificial friends 
that leave when things get tough and you will still be miserable even 
when you get good at hiding it.
[Flexbuttchef]: Your advice about hygiene and style is fine but the whole “just 
change yourself bro” is no different than “just work harder bro.” It 
doesn’t make any sense. Personality isn’t all that malleable. You’re 
born with a genome you didn’t choose, said genome interacts a certain 
way with the environment and randomness of life which to the extent that
 it matters most you have no control over. It’s mostly just luck of the 
draw, which is why even though I’ve never had a period of time in my 
life where I lacked friends, other people have gone their entire lives 
without a true friend. It would be absurd to tell them “just change 
yourself bro” as if they haven’t already made the effort, did what they 
were “supposed” to and still came up short.
I’ve never made a conscious effort to seek friends, I’ve always 
just sort of had them, if anything I’ve made an effort to have less. And
 you’re gonna say that the people who don’t have any are fundamentally 
doing something wrong or not trying? Maybe some but all of them? I don’t
 think so.
[Goldbolt_2004]: sui-
[Individual_Speech_10]: I already am the kind of person I want to be friends with, a nice, funny person that isn't perfect and has empathy.
[[deleted]]: Maybe. I spent my whole life improving myself.
I can make people laugh. I can get laid easily with whoever. I can
 inspire people. I help people for fun because I enjoy it. Got a first 
class degree in a technical subject. Not even feeling myself, most 
people think I'm handsome and smart and hung (see my twitter lol); I've 
got everything going for me.
Guess what, I still don't fit in. Don't get opportunities. Never 
will. It was never about me. It's other people who are the problem. 
People just are just pretty small-minded and petty and worry way too 
much about what everyone else thinks and can't be authentic.
I'm the guy who sees people hanging out alone at the petrol 
station at 3am and doesn't think theyre dangerous and gives them some 
company. The guy who sees people with mental issues and doesn't judge 
and makes them feel welcome. The guy who sees a group and goes to hang 
out with the ones who are being left out.
Unfortunately, this kind of guy is not the person who most people 
like. Because people are pussies and users. Fuck them. Come hit me up, 
freaks and geeks.
[smol_boi2004]: Imma be honest mate, I’d love to do these things. Before 
graduating high school I lived in the gym. Took a mile lap then ran my 
skinny ahh to the gym every chance I got cause it was fun to work out 
with the mates. But college is sapping a lot more than my time rn. I’ve 
been having trouble finishing work and I’ve been told that’s due to burn
 out, and I have to work as a substitute teacher to pay off my car.
I’ve got near constant stress about grades because the program I 
want to get into requires a lot of things including a damn good GPA. 
It’s been getting better though. I’m currently set to join the Mock 
Trial team next semester, and I’m hoping to make some friends along the 
way. But for right now being at home and depressed is the best I can 
manage
[PhilosophicalGoof]: Changing yourself into something you aren’t because you want to be
 liked by other? I understand bettering yourself and fixing your flaw 
but becoming an entirely different person because you want to be liked 
is not the motivation you should use to improve on yourself.
Do it because you wanna see someone you dream of being but not because you think it will make someone like you more.
[the_gopnik_fish]: Did you just say I have no bitches⁉️⁉️🤬🤬🤬
[Pyotr_09]: look, i'm not always negative, it's just that i'm a bit weird and 
can't really talk to people, or make up something, anything in return 
for people to enjoy being around me in anyway
trust me, i tried, for real, but i really can't and won't try stop
 being alone anymore, small talk is boring and i'm really bad at it
maybe there are some people with whom I could actually have a 
pretty productive conversation with, but i've just tried too much to 
think that I could actually find it
it's sad, but it's just how life goes, some people are not born for it
[MrStruts96]: Depressed because 0 friends, 0 friends because depressed. Can’t like ourselves when there’s nothing to like.
[[deleted]]: Fuck off.
[IchSterbeJa]: Hah. Yeah. If only
[BunkerSquirre1]: Part of my problem is as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized I’m 
physically incapable of being ‘the guy’ I want to be. Like my brain 
literally isn’t wired for it. That all those years trying to be that 
person was fake and unsustainable. It’s been devastating and incredibly 
hard to keep going but isolating myself makes it easier to forget that 
this is permanent and there’s no cure.
[Clunk_Westwonk]: I’m not negative at all lol, I just wasn’t able to keep any friends from highschool.
[le-strule]: Thanks to your big block of bs I'm finally cured
[Alarming-Gear001]: oh boy anotherr/GenZbanger consisting of first page of google advice

[ForsaketheVoid]: i agree with the message, but the tone is so weird.
like "hey, you've just got to be more positive, you disgusting, 
depressing, unhygienic, alcoholic, unself-aware piece of shit, before 
you live to the grand old age of 45 and realize what a pathetic, 
friendless loser you've grown to become"
this feels like the self-help version of negging xD

ikr, it exhales "people get what they deserve" vibes at their FINEST.

[wafflemakers2]: I would be friends with or date myself. I'm not picky

like or want to be.

Hey if youre happy like this then fair enough dude :)
I think this is for the people that complain about society and how why it is the reason they have no friends

[PureBee4900]: The worst part is that some so-called platitudes are real even if 
they sound like bullshit, but they don't work until you come to those 
realizations yourself.
Changing your perceptions works, finding positives in the negative
 works, doing cringe shit like yoga actually works lol. I dont know if 
the edgelords in the comments are ready for that though
[JaimeeLannisterr]: I’m diagnosed autistic. Tried all my life to make friends but it’s
 just impossible for me, I can’t connect with people at all. When I had 
friends all those years ago I was always the second or third wheel 
before they ditched me completely
[ToPimpAPenguin]: Wow I never considered just doing what i want. Genius
[QueZorreas]: I did.
I like depressed people with no friends.
[Fearless_Surprise_75]: oh, okay, like i haven't been trying that for most of my life
[FreeflyOrLeave]: I tried getting my skin clear. My doctor told me I had to take 
birth control to get on medication for my hormonal acne. So, I told him I
 needed to talk to my psychiatrist first. My psychiatrist said it wasn’t
 his issue and he didn’t give a shit about pointing me in the right 
direction, and wouldn’t let me explain I had an appointment with my PCP 
after this. He told me to stfu.
So I got put on birth control, had a mental break, and had the cops called for suicidal ideation that Itoldmy doctor would occur if I was not monitored. Now I have no 
psychiatrist, no acne medication, all I have is worsened depression and 
worsened acne and a newfound sense of hatred for our system.
You don’t even get help if you try to help yourself, lol.
[Omen46]: I do like myself but other people seem to have issues with who I 
am idk it’s weird. Like u made tons of friends then one called me a 
sociopath the other tried stealing my gf which he was ugly so didn’t 
work. Like idk guys seem to hate me because im tall and better looking 
than them
[[deleted]]: Mfw I quit being negative all my negative ass “friends” dropped me
[swordviper121]: More of this! At the end of the day, I genuinely think people can 
become the best versions of themselves but what’s stopping people is so 
much negativity. Especially on this app which like is a nest of it. 
Seriously, the best way to make friends is to work at it
[FreshPitch6026]: Didn't need a full blown post for that, what's wrong with you.
[[deleted]]: Im 25M, i dont have friends over 15 years cuz im disability usher 
syndrome type 2, deaf, hard hearing, tunnel vision, unemployed 5 years, 
hard find job cuz im bad communication skills 😕
[7-rats-in-a-coat]: Go birdwatching!! Seriously, getting into birding is crazy, it got
 me outside regularly and I became more curious about the world around 
me
[LordTuranian]: Well that or become your own best friend.
0 bitches (male or female)

[crusoe]: It's not gonna be WW3.
Xi can't afford it and the PLA can't force project.
Russia can barely manage Ukraine.
Iran and Houthis don't have a navy that matters.
Everyone else who matters is either neutral or pro US.
This will be some short lived regional conflict if anything.
The last time we fought Iran it was over in 2 weeks and we decided to stop because they no longer had a Navy.
The US has now produced 1000 f35s. Russia is down to a handful of SU-34s and has like 6 Su57s.
Christ where is all this WW3 nonsense coming from? Anything that happens will be less involved than desert storm.
The Chinese / Russian agitprop is still very effective at selling themselves I guess.
And yet German, Swedish and the military of my country claims that
 we could be facing aggression from Russia in this decade. And these 
aren't some comments that are open for interpretation, it's literally 
top military personnel stating that war is not only possible, but 
likely.
You can see how comments by random people online don't necessarily feel me with optimism.
Suppose it somehowdoesdevelop into WW3 - who do you think is gonna win?
The US still has an obscenely gargantuan military and allies all over.
No one wins a world war. We’re all fucked
If trump wins he wants to pull out of nato. So Russia could start 
harassing more countries. And for as long as trump was president the US 
likely wouldn't join the war. Trump supports Russia but is anti China so
 we wouldn't join. It took us awhile to join ww2 so it's not like 
sitting out a world War is unprecedented.
Trump plans to stay in power longer than 4 years and if he dies 
he'll likely try to pass of the country to another crony. Either way the
 whole thing could go poorly
I do think think Biden will beat trump. But there's a lot of 
unknowns. It would be dumb for Xi to start a war but there's plenty of 
instances where people in high positions make bad choices because their 
concerns are different than the peoples
Russia can’t fight a WW they can barely invade Ukraine
Eh, they're just scaring you. Russia isn't gonna do anything 
unless something changes dramatically for them, and that would take a 
miracle.
The entire generation is Chicken Little, running around screaming the sky is falling!
We can't go one day without Chinese manufacturing either. It's all so stupid. The news is fake.
Well, if people weren't married to their iPhone and SM....
the mistake here is you think when we say WW3 we mean WW2 again

[DjBamberino]: The environment is not dying. We are making it inhospitable to 
ourselves, but the environment will go on even if humans go extinct.
Not only that but there are lots of things to be happy about! The 
beautiful colors in the sky, the stars and sun and moon, spending time 
with people you love, making art and music, doing good for other people,
 the feeling of clean clothes, or a much needed shower…. I could go on 
but I think you get the idea. This is not to diminish the suffering 
going on, I see my fellow humans and other animals hurting, and we need 
to improve the world, but there ARE things to be happy about. Those are 
the things which should drive us to improve the world.
The ocean life is dying, which will eventually lead to a catastrophic reaction.
Sure, but there have been catastrophic environmental circumstances
 which have occurred before, and life has prevailed. I’m not saying 
“things will be fine nothing bad will happen”, I’m saying things will be
 bad, and could be really really really bad. But, i do not think the 
current environmental catastrophe which we are already in the middle and
 continue to hurtle into will be the complete end of life on earth. It 
could result in the extinction of our species and many many other 
species, though.
Guys its fine stop stressing, WE might suffer excruciating 
circumstances and possibly kill off our entire species and many more but
 bacteria that thrive in lava will live on so its nbd really.
“The ENviRonMeNT iSn’T DyInG tHE PeOPlE aRe FUcKeD”
And?
This is a naive notion. All life can change in a generation. Ocean
 life will be dead in 200 years if we do not change course. All of it. 
The jetsream will stop, the last of the ice will melt the oceans will 
acidify breaking down the shells of every shellfish, poisoning the 
totality of the ocean for thousands of years.
Methane bubbles trapped under arctic ice will prompt a continued 
warming until IIRC about a 5c warming. At which point the ocean current 
itself will shut down as it will have reached basically the same 
temperature across its surface. At which point the choking air of 
rotting fish carcasses, trillions, will kill every mammal.
Every mammal.
This in combination with a series of fires to the once beautiful 
landscape will choke out the sun bringing on a cooling event.
Sponges might survive, moss, those things.
Nothing animate.
No life.
Stillness after a flame.
This is the reality. This is what the saudis want, this is what 
Bezos and Biden and Macron want. This is what Xi and Trudeau want. This 
is what Putin, Merkel, Lopez-Obrador want.
This is the future we have if we do not act irrationally, and 
fast. We can reason ourselves into hope if we want to but then our great
 grandchildren will die in the smog.

[Angry_Sparrow]: The ocean life is dying, which will eventually lead to a catastrophic reaction.
Sure, but there have been catastrophic environmental circumstances
 which have occurred before, and life has prevailed. I’m not saying 
“things will be fine nothing bad will happen”, I’m saying things will be
 bad, and could be really really really bad. But, i do not think the 
current environmental catastrophe which we are already in the middle and
 continue to hurtle into will be the complete end of life on earth. It 
could result in the extinction of our species and many many other 
species, though.
Guys its fine stop stressing, WE might suffer excruciating 
circumstances and possibly kill off our entire species and many more but
 bacteria that thrive in lava will live on so its nbd really.

And?
This is a naive notion. All life can change in a generation. Ocean
 life will be dead in 200 years if we do not change course. All of it. 
The jetsream will stop, the last of the ice will melt the oceans will 
acidify breaking down the shells of every shellfish, poisoning the 
totality of the ocean for thousands of years.
Methane bubbles trapped under arctic ice will prompt a continued 
warming until IIRC about a 5c warming. At which point the ocean current 
itself will shut down as it will have reached basically the same 
temperature across its surface. At which point the choking air of 
rotting fish carcasses, trillions, will kill every mammal.
Every mammal.
This in combination with a series of fires to the once beautiful 
landscape will choke out the sun bringing on a cooling event.
Sponges might survive, moss, those things.
Nothing animate.
No life.
Stillness after a flame.
This is the reality. This is what the saudis want, this is what 
Bezos and Biden and Macron want. This is what Xi and Trudeau want. This 
is what Putin, Merkel, Lopez-Obrador want.
This is the future we have if we do not act irrationally, and 
fast. We can reason ourselves into hope if we want to but then our great
 grandchildren will die in the smog.

Since the dawn of humanity threats loomed in our existential 
background. What do you do about the threat of COVID? The same thing the
 caveman did when a fucking lion was stalking him for weeks. Exist, and 
move on with your life while enjoying the moments  of whatever state of 
being you prefer.
[Lethalbroccoli]: Relax.
Indulging in media all the time is making you fearful of everything.
What's the fucking use in being a doomer.
Don't be a doomer.
Also the environment isn't "dying". Life is dying, yes, it always 
dies, why wouldn't it? CO2 is essential for all plant life, so in turn, 
basically all life. "Climate change reversal plans" could potentially 
drop CO2 levels to 150ppm or lower which could be disastrous for plant 
life, and us.
Pollution, is another thing however. We cannot be dumping waste 
into water sources and failing to dispose of our trash. Pollution is the
 real killer of plant and animal life.
Feel free to downvote or call me a conspiracy nutcase or whatever 
names you want to. I'm just advising you that you should relax, and stop
 believing this doomsday society we live in and do what you need to do.
Edit: completely forgot to talk about ww3. Oh wait there's nothing

 something exciting will happen and ww3 will commence.

[Prestigious_Stop8403]: Pretty much. Dave Chappell did a skit that captured this topic well.
He argued that watching the news is like watching the Challenger 
explosion in real time, but repeating the experience every single day.
Having access to this much information has certainly made the 
world more interconnected, but the trade off, is that not all the 
information is ideal for human consumption. Shocker right?
Here’s something to cheer you up!
[Stubborncomrade]: Here’s something to cheer you up!
[Mean_Fae]: Eavesdropping Xer here. Can confirm. For us, when I was in 5th 
grade, they told us we could all die of AIDS. Every day was another day 
Russia might nuke us as we sat at our flip top school desks. Watched the
 Challenger explode in front of my face, but they repeated it on the 
news in a constant loop to keep the trauma fresh.And then when I was a 
teenager, all technology was going to explode in 2000. "By the year 
two-thousand" was burned into our head for the metric af all sorts of 
critical mass events for the 10 years leading up to it.
Russia never nuked us, and my friends never gave me AIDS. 
Pointless anxiety. You may or may not believe in Jesus, but that dude

[InGreedWeTrust3]: I remember back in 2014, I believe, Facebook ran a study to see 
how much they could influence people’s moods by flooding their feeds 
with positive or negative material. It clearly showed that they could 
control people’s moods. My conspiratorial mindset makes me believe all 
of social media is just a complex form of mind control. They are 
purposely making people depressed. A weak, depressed population is far 
easier to control.

For one week in January 2012, data scientists skewed what almost 
700,000 Facebook users saw when they logged into its service. Some 
people were shown content with a preponderance of happy and positive 
words; some were shown content analyzed as sadder than average. And when
 the week was over, these manipulated users were more likely to post 
either especially positive or negative words themselves.
Attention=profit, fuck social media, judge your life by what's actually happening around you
Agree but I would replace control with profit from and off of, for better and for worse.
It's this, people engage more when something makes them angry than
 when something makes them happy, and more engagement=more profits.

Imo the best you can do is hope you can be surrounded by good people and enjoyyourlife. I'm not saying pay no attention but talking does little good. 
Instead focus on concise actions like voting or volunteering. I try to 
live in the moment as much as possible, and this not involving a screen

 to think any of this is fun or normal through 15 second tiktok videos 
and mildlyinteresting posts on reddit.
25M and I am probably in the top 10% of income for our age, and 
here I am, living modestly and still not able to do anything I am 
passionate about… except riding a motorcycle which is inherently 
dangerous and runs the risk of death. My situation is just one of the 
countless GenZ stories about how fucked up things have become, from our 
GenX parents getting divorced, opiate crises, cost of healthcare, 
education, and general living, unless you come from vast familial 
wealth, odds are, some of the typical american bullshit will seep its 
way into your life.
What’s best, is that we’re all blatantly aware of how terrible 
things are and frankly, how easy some of the problems that plague modern
 society would be to fix, and yet, we are all virtually powerless to do 
anything about it. We’ve accepted our fate in a late stage capitalist 
society. Hope the boomers are happy that they’ve exploited virtually 
everything in the name of profit, despite the fact that you’ve 
irreparably ruined the planet for your grandchildren, you dumb mother

I gotta be honest with you all. If you want a better outlook on 
life block this subreddit. I read the post and comments and it’s always 
doom and gloom. That is going to reinforce the negative outlook.
You want to se me the beauty and joy of life find the beauty and 
joy of life. You want to be sad and depressed surround yourselves with 
it and you will be. Life is hard enough what’s the point in making 
harder by only focusing on the bad?
Case in point my first kid was born when I was 15. Did it suck? 
Sure did! Now though 35 years later two more kids with the same woman 
and three grandkids all that suck is thought of as the “good old days.” 
Where we scraped by hobbled our penny’s together and found a way 
through. The entire world said we wouldn’t make it. But I put my wife 
through college my daughter and my son’s followed me into the military 
and provided their own educations. Their choice I would have paid. Quick
 context on my early life. I brought home $340 every two weeks. My rent 
was $360 and car payment was $140 a month. While my wife and children 
never went without food I most certainly did multiple times. So it 
wasn’t that much easier then. We just couldn’t have what everyone else 
did and had to wait and work for it.
If this subreddit or Reddit for that matter existed then I would be rotting in my own depression as well.
I really hope I’m making it clear that I’m not lecturing anyone, 
and I’m most certainly not judging anyone. I really hope this is just 
helpful advice.
With all that being said I will now show myself to the door and

If one reacts to misery porn a condemnation of its own reality 
then they aren't in a position to explain why. Maybe the notion of 
having to extend sympathy to someone like that is non starter. Maybe 
they literally can't comprehend why someone who otherwise lives in the

I see it everywhere, spouted by all sorts of folk from the 
n'er-do-well's to the naive - that somehow we are so much worse off then
 every other generation ever and are incredibly anxious and depressed.
It's a load of shit, an Illusion. In just the past 20 years, We 
have gotten much, much better at diagnosing disorders (perhaps too 
liberally these days), things that were once incredibly taboo (therapy, 
diagnosis of disorder, discussion of it) are now commonplace, and those 
two work in tandem to produce higher rates of diagnosis exponentially.
But the fact is, every other generation was like that. Just 
because their struggles went undiagnosed doesn't mean the same rate of 
them weren't struggling, it just means they kept it quiet and inside, 
much to their mental detriment.
Even back in 1972 (heavy silent/boomer era), the Eagles released 
the first album, containing a track called MOST OF US ARE SAD, which 
charted, along with the album itself, very well, propelling the Eagles 
to a decade-long affair with lady fame.
"Most of us are sad.. no one lets it show"
It doesn't matter where you drop your pushpin on the tree of 
recorded human history. Humans have always been sad and nervous, or if 
evolved, depressed and anxious.
Thanks for coming to my TED talk! Kindly stop repeating the lie 
that we are so much more terribly anxious and depressed then every other
 generation put together, please and thank you.

[iamawesome4]: I’m actually doing a study on this. How stigma in the past lead 
older generations to not seek help for their mental health or even know 
they might not be mental healthy. I will probably end up posting the 
survey in a couple days so you guys can participate!
[Truewit_]: Yep, we really need to ask ourselves "how on earth could The Doors
 have been popular if people weren't fucking miserable in 1967?"
It's true, people have been miserable (and clinically depressed) 
forever. I think one of the major problems now, particularly in the US, 
is that prescriptions are given arbitrarily in order to push medication 
which will naturally inflate the numbers in studies. It's probably also 
lead to a greater number of people identifying as clinically depressed 
who may not actually be simply because of the ubiquity of the diagnoses.
That said there's also plenty more to be miserable about now 
compared with 50 years ago. We're facing generational and special 
catastrophes left, right and centre. Bad pay, expensive housing, climate
 change, threat of nuclear war, generational condescension from those in
 power, almost total powerlessness to change anything due to our social 
and economic atomisation etc...

[savchik]: I think you're perfectly justified to be jaded because it's the 
natural response to being consciously aware of the current situation
[PIT_VIPER13]: I remember reading somewhere that this was mainly because they 
only recently started checking on youth mental health, maybe as early as
 the mid 90's possibly later, hence why gen z is so messed up, in 
comparison to previous generations, I'll see if I can find it.
[Berriesssss]: True and also nowadays mental health is way more talked about. 
When my parents were teens nobody really talked about mental health. Now
 it’s a lot less stigmatized.
[beardedkingface]: Generations have gotten more sad in their teenage years. Gen Z in 
particular is dealing with the fallout of having the internet, being 
constantly connected, and the pitfalls of instant gratification etc.
Us Millenials feel it too, but not to the same extent as you. We 
were offline in our formative years so we weren't as impacted.
I'm more worried about Gen Alpha tbh, the 2 year olds with iPads while mommy and daddy eat dinner at a restaurant
[ayowhoevenisthis]: honestly i think either this generation IS  more anxious/depressed
 or just has a higher risk to develop one of those mental health 
disabilities.  sure they might be more open to talk about but that 
doesn't really change anything, there's a lot to be anxious about covid,
 racism, doxing (in fact i was so scared about the blue whale challenge 
and that id get doxed or whatever that not only did i have a panic 
attack but i was anxious for the next 3 days)  saying that it happens 
less just cause its more socially acceptable to talk about is like 
saying std rates dropped cause its more socially acceptable to talk 
about (they're actually rising) and with everyone wanting to fit in and 
with things changing fast  people are gonna get anxious and depressed 
cause of everything going on. like if you don't have this new pair of 
shoes your a loser or people are gonna laugh at you if you think a 
diffrent way.  and a lot of people are scared to speak out and a lot of 
 parents aren't the most supportive and what makes it worse is that 
those cheesy mental health presentations don't help anyone, and don't 
get me started with the counselors, 10 times out of 9 they either don't 
help at all or they make it worse.
but that's just my dumb opinion expressed in text form with bad grammar.
[Ostrich2401]: No one in my entire class is depressed or anxious (however there 
are only like 25 kids in my class). I don't know where people get it 
from.
just luck of the draw. there was an astronomical amount of people 
at my HS who were depressed or anxious, but there were 1500 people in my
 grade alone
[GunnzzNRoses]: just luck of the draw. there was an astronomical amount of people

[DragonSwagin]: is’t
[SerialFreeloader123]: The most pampered individuals are the ones who whine the most about trivial thing.
Same applies to generations. We are probably the most pampered generation to ever exist.
I think teenagers have always whines about shit

The amount of posts about Trump or Man vs Woman in dating or posts
 shaming ppl for being short or calling every guy an incel or ever girl a
 gold diggers is just getting stupid and ridiculous. The amount of times
 you talk about "Patriarchy" or "Male loneliness" or "incels" or Trump 
is just more poison to your well being. Do you ever feel good scrolling 
through this sub? Do you ever introspect on the time you've spent on 
this sub and going "Wow, I had such a great time". Genuinely, take a 
deep breath. Just 5 minutes stare at a wall and think about all the 
times you spent on this sub. The only fun time I've had with reddit was 
with my friends on discord laughing at posts or stories. It just feels 
like the discourse is so dictated by Western(Mainly AMERICAN) politics 
and media. It's just so tiring, like you think you're the center of the 
world or something.
And before you say: "YoU'rE a TrUmP sUpPoRtEr", I'm not american so idc.

[Affectionate_Ad9592]: Scrolling through this sub has just shown me gen z has a serious 
identity crisis and a lot of left wing people trying to recruit you to

[Technical-Monk-374]: Yeah, americans are kinda annnoying by being so loud about their

[GD_Smangry]: I remember when getting this app in the first place, I just wanted to look at the funny post fromr/TIHIorr/Blursedimages. Now just seeing way too many people talking about political opinions (at least on this sub) just ruins the fun.

[KalaronV]: This includes liberals, leftists, conservatives, and even Trump himself
This is, unironically, terrible advice.
No, you shouldn't assume that everyone is trying to make a good world by protecting the ones they love, especially notpoliticians,especiallynotfascists that are currently, knowingly, deliberately sending people to a
 fuckin' work camp in Venezuela against Judicial Orders.
Like, Jesus christ,a teacher was just told to take down a sign saying "Everyone is welcome, respected, valued, equal....here", how can you possibly explain that as "Well, the guy that told her to take it downexplicitly because he said not everyone believes that everyone is equalwas just trying to protect people".
The reality, the cold and unfortunate fact of the world, is that there aremeanandtwistedpeople in this world that lack the basic building blocks of empathy and
 humanity that you and I have. To acknowledge their existence is to 
acknowledge that not every politician is "trying to do what's best for 
everyone", because for a hell of a lot of them "What's best" is their 
personal enrichment and the oppression of others.
[No_Relative_6734]: Many people on Reddit are angry, bitter trolls
Real life isn't like this
[rando_anon123]: I think this sub is one of the more toxic ones I've seen.
[LGgyibf3558]: That's fair but even in subs completely unrelated to politics its 
being discussed. It just gets so tiring seeing the same topics or views 
or events.
I can understand getting tired of it, but that's just how it works
 when you get world-shaking events. It's kind of like walking into a 
Barbershop and hearing about how your favorite sports team lost, and 
then going "Oh my god, don't you realize I already heard about this at 
home".
Yes, you did. But the others are talking about it. It's the nature
 of living in a time when a Fascist is in office, you don't exactly get 
to forget about politics.

[[deleted]]: Welcome to to the internet. This is what the internet is. This is 
social media. All of it is designed to get you angry and keep your 
attention. If you find yourself in a toxic cesspit it is you that is 
curating the algorithm to give you it. Instagram shows an ideal world 
that doesn't exist. Reddit is almost entirely subs you subscribed to if 
you want it to be. Twitter is simply fucked and Facebook gave a voice 
and community to everyone including the worst people that wouldn't have 
an audience otherwise. Tiktok is trying to dry your attention span and 
depress you so you can find some dopamine every 5th video.
[ApartMachine90]: My most sane days was off of reddit. I curse myself for going back
 onto this app. Outside of niche communities for hobbies this website is
 pure garbage.

The Stock Market has crashed, Housing is completely unaffordable,

and very little has changed politically. What would your priorities be?

There's a ground well on the property I need to get running... Also several streams
Even if a full economic collapse happens im confident me and

be no power and gas will run out fast. But long term power outages are

Depression is by living very frugally and networking the shit out of the

That or try and be totally self sufficient by living off the land but even that is very risky.

[togayther]: my econ teacher said 2020 hits another recession. it's gonna be our problem in the future guys ://
Trust me, this is going to be a very mild Recession unlike the 
last one or the early 80’s. If anything, it would look more like the 
2002 dotcom bubble. Also, we haven’t reached an economic bubble yet. 
We’re a little high on the earnings to stock price side (I think) but 
we’re not off the charts yet. This Recession will be caused by Trump and
 tariffs (which other countries have already begun) not an economic 
bubble.
I don’t see how he could know that. Recessions are fundamentally 
unpredictable, so you shouldn’t worry about it. Expansions do not die of
 old age either.
Next time he brings up his prediction, mention this:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1465-7295.1993.tb00874.x

How do you know that cryptocurrency will appreciate in a recession?
Comment deleted by user
This doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. What kind of inflation are
 you expecting exactly? The federal reserve targets low and stable 
inflation for a number of reasons, but during negative output gaps 
deflation aggravates recessions by depressing aggregate demand. And how 
do you know that bitcoin would be a superior asset to hold still?
Comment deleted by user
The United States, unlike Venezuela, has an independent central 
bank so the government cannot force the central bank to purchase its 
securities and cause lots of inflation.
no one can force inflation on crypto
Ironically, bitcoin and company have much more volatile inflation 
rates than the dollar. In the span of a few months, bitcoin lost over 
75% of it’s value while the dollar reliably inflates around 2% a year 
since it has an independent central bank to stabilize the price level.

You're thinking of value, which I agree swings wildly, at least due to speculation.
If a bitcoin loses value, that’s inflation. It lost purchasing power.
Also just because the fed manages inflation  doesn't mean the fed 
controls the mint. If the government really needed cash, they could 
resort to just printing massive amounts of it.
The mint does not control the money supply; the federal reserve 
does. The mint simply creates physical notes, which it does only as 
ordered by the federal reserve when depository institutions withdraw 
money from their reserve accounts.
But let's say the fed stays active and the gov doesn't print a ton of money
The United States government cannot print money. It is not allowed to affect the money supply.
Those countries alone could drive crypto value way up, making it 
one of the few assets that holds value or rises in a global economic 
failure.
How do you know? What’s your model? What empirical evidence is 
there that crypto would behave in the way you’re claiming during a 
depression? You can’t just claim it would happen from a priori 
reasoning.
Comment deleted by user
The US treasury controls the mint. Just because it usually prints 
money only on request of the fed, the department can still just go and 
print cash whenever they want. Print enough and start circulating it, 
and the fed isn't going to be able to control the money supply.
No... that’s not how it works. They’re by law not allowed to do 
such things. The federal reserve is fully independent and has sole 
discretion over monetary policy. The government cannot in anyway receive
 direct funding through the federal reserve like you’re suggesting. 
Trump cannot order up a fresh batch of dollars from the mint for 
seigniorage; it’s illegal.

print cash whenever they want. Print enough and start circulating it, 
and the fed isn't going to be able to control the money supply.
No... that’s not how it works. They’re by law not allowed to do 
such things. The federal reserve is fully independent and has sole 
discretion over monetary policy. The government cannot in anyway receive
 direct funding through the federal reserve like you’re suggesting. 
Trump cannot order up a fresh batch of dollars from the mint for 
seigniorage; it’s illegal.
[[deleted]]: You're thinking of value, which I agree swings wildly, at least due to speculation.
If a bitcoin loses value, that’s inflation. It lost purchasing power.
Also just because the fed manages inflation  doesn't mean the fed 
controls the mint. If the government really needed cash, they could 
resort to just printing massive amounts of it.
The mint does not control the money supply; the federal reserve 
does. The mint simply creates physical notes, which it does only as 
ordered by the federal reserve when depository institutions withdraw 
money from their reserve accounts.
But let's say the fed stays active and the gov doesn't print a ton of money
The United States government cannot print money. It is not allowed to affect the money supply.
Those countries alone could drive crypto value way up, making it 
one of the few assets that holds value or rises in a global economic 
failure.
How do you know? What’s your model? What empirical evidence is 
there that crypto would behave in the way you’re claiming during a 
depression? You can’t just claim it would happen from a priori 
reasoning.

I feel like that I have no interest in sex and always want to be 
alone. Meanwhile, I refuse anyone’s advice, help or questions, and just 
want to solve problem by myself.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[[deleted]]: Depression is when you lack genuine interest in most things, your 
social life withers slowly or has hints on negativity to them, you 
isolate yourself, and you might enjoy slight physical pain (self 
inflicted or not) because it feels better than the mental and emotional 
pain.
It’s a mental block. It’s one not believing they’re ever going to 
get better. It’s refusing to believe the positivity that others want to 
bring to the table. It’s knowing how to feign happiness so others leave 
you alone. It’s wanting them to not leave you alone and see through your
 persona, but also not wanting them either. It’s ruminating in what ails
 you and finding a sense of comfort in it. It’s completing all of your 
vital tasks while not taking care of yourself even if you have the time 
to do so. It’s losing the motivation to go above and beyond if that’s 
who you know yourself to be.
It’s tough out here dude. We’ll get through it, though. Keep in 
mind that you are more than whatever has you in whichever rut you find 
yourself in. People do genuinely want to help. People do genuinely want 
the best for you. And even if you haven’t sunk deep, keep the positives 
in mind before you go down an endless abyss of sadness.
[Fantastic_Ebb2390]: Depression is when you're not interested in anything at all, and 
it lasts for a long time. If it's just about not being interested in 
sex, then that might be called a lack of libido. Maybe it's because you 
haven't met someone who truly excites you yet, and that does require 
some luck. But now, with AI development, there are more efficient ways 
to help us find compatible people quickly, whether for making friends or
 finding a partner. You might want to giveLightup,
 a Discord community, a try. You can match with users who have posted 
similar content by posting your own thoughts. It's an interesting way to
 meet people who have had similar experiences or thoughts, and it's much
 easier than relying solely on luck. Perhaps when you meet someone who 
understands you and you enjoy being around, your perspective will 
change.
Least obvious astroturfing attempt
[-The_Punisher]: Least obvious astroturfing attempt
[[deleted]]: Someone who is truly depressed always has that one look in their 
eyes that screams "I'm really not caring about life". It's hard to hide 
even with a smile while work/school/family is there. It's being present 
while being miles away at the same time.
[Hess20]: Depression is often characterized by "down moods" for over a span 
of at least 2 weeks. The down moods may include everything from 
hopelessness, thoughts of death, isolation, short fused anger (smallest 
things make you explode), a lack of emotion, a lack of energy, hard time
 sleeping, and loads of other symptoms. For subtle signs, an individual 
may self isolate a lot, decline any social gatherings, have a hard time 
focusing, always look dead tired, a sudden loss of interest in 
activities/hobbies, etc.
You may get a feeling when you speak to them and look them in the eye, you can just read them/feel something is off.

[[deleted]]: Agree
[pc-21-37]: Depression is when you feel the wait of the world caving in on 
you, when even your own reality and existence just exist. You can’t find
 purpose or happiness in anything from sex, to shows and movies, to 
hobbies, to nothing.
[ssiao]: I have a non existent social life and I don’t think I’m depressed
[King-Brisingr]: The subtle signs are plastered on them. The not so subtle ones 
probably too. If you're worried, talk to peers and people who love you. 
And the resources and help and support will come.
[Realityhrts]: Can indicate depression does not mean it definitely does indicate it. Sometimes we just go through weird periods of time.
[M2Fream]: They are always very excited to hang out, but on the day of the 
plans, they cant. Whether they are sick, tired, other family 
obligation... they just dont want to hang out when the time comes.
[Lime_Drinks]: how often you have sex or urges to do so, really isn't an 
indicator of being depressed. you're depressed due to self-isolation. 
get actual friends, not a relationship.
[Lilyflower24681]: Not texting you for over a week…

I’m 23, and I went to see my family for Christmas. I realized that
 I don’t feel truly connected with them. When we talk about having fun, 
all they want to do is get drunk, and that’s what fun means to them, I 
got into an argument with my uncles about it because they think I seem 
bored for not drinking alcohol. I realized how unhappy and emotionally 
repressed they are. Most of them are Gen X, and many of them are 
divorced.
I went on TikTok, and I see all those TikToks about people feeling
 this Christmas is different. I am not sure if it is because we, as Gen 
Z, don’t find alcohol fun anymore. It makes people more depressed and 
act in a stupid way. It’s nice having a drink and enjoying it, but not 
drinking to get fucked. I just do not enjoy that anymore.
(I’m not saying all families are like that mine is just special)

[DataSittingAlone]: Mine was pretty good and I don't think alcohol has something to do
 with it I'm half Mexican and half white so I basically got two 
Christmas parties and one of them everyone got drunk and we had a good 
time and the other one nobody got drunk and we had a good time. It's 
really about the people, feel bad for you that you don't have people 
like that in your life.
Im 100% Mexican and every family party is the same, they just get drunk and act stupid haha
Some of us come from alcoholic or dysfunctional families and when 
we're in our twenties is when we figure it out and decide to take some 
distance. It sounds like you are going in a healthy direction, keep 
going! You can love your family but not be limited to be the way they 
are. You might expect some kickback for growing beyond them. There is a 
book called "Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents" by Gibson 
you might like.
Thanks for the recommendation, I’ll check it out !
Perhaps it seems prudish but my family doesn’t drink at all and 
our Christmas was delightful, I think alcohol mostly just exemplifies 
whatever the vibe is, so if family relations aren’t already great, 
alcohol will just increase that gap

Yeah the holidays always suck when you're alone.
As someone with a broken family i couldn't agree more. I wish i

 my dad has my back though.

[sr603]: I mean,
I came down with a cold on christmas eve and was really bad into the evening. Christmas day was better.
We had my step son for the holiday this time and he had fun so ide say it worked out
[CountyTop8606]: Yup spent Christmas completely alone. Estranged from dad and my 
mother passed. Just went on a long jog to clear my head and Christmas 
dinner was a six pack. Also, your family sounds incredibly fun from my 
perspective lol. But yeah I still do know what you mean, some people 
aren't just chill, happy, and fun when they drink. People who get all 
emotional and angry when they drink are the fucking worst.
[Huntsvegas97]: Frankly, I’ve been depressed this entire season. We hosted 
Christmas since my husband and I have two kids and the biggest house. My
 mom passed away in 2018, so nothing has ever felt quite the same since.
 On top of that, one of my brothers is distancing himself from me and 
refuses to see me right now (super complicated long story). There’s more
 but I’ve just been so sad this whole season and Christmas was extra 
depressing. I still did everything I could to make Christmas great for 
my husband and kids and rest of the family. Holidays just suck right now
[Kitty_Fruit_2520]: Mine wasn’t even that bad 😕 it sounds like you don’t have the best family.
[Lonk0279]: I spent christmas with my dad. It felt empty without my sisters or mom even trying to reach out. My dad's great though.
[Positive-Avocado-881]: Honestly I feel the same way when I’m with my siblings, but it 
sure beats how I spent Christmas. Which was alone in my apartment 
because I couldn’t afford travel this year

My father is a black hole of need and selfishness. He is dying of 
cancer but still has the energy to stir up trouble for everyone, turned 
christmas dinner into a fight with my mother, over nothing. She is just 
full of rage and instead of just not hosting dinner she turns it into an
 expression of her rage.
My cousins wanted to hang out on Christmas eve. It was fun at 
first but they got wasted (they stay wasted honestly) and it turned into
 a big fight between a couple of them and one of their husbands. More 
rage
My sister and I are tired of the dysfunction and it's becoming 
unbearable to us. IMO family units can fail and this one is a failure. I
 don't know why these people didn't hit their limit and try to actually 
go have a nice life. But they're "conservative" and "Christian" so 
they're all doing "the right thing" by staying in relationships and 
hanging out with family they hate.
[Helix3501]: This year felt different, idk, like the beginning of the end
[seattleseahawks2014]: Frankly, mine was fine.
[rustys_shackled_ford]: I was kicked out of my home of ten years with about 2 weeks 
notice, and with my absolute out date being the 21st. I'm on SSI and 
make less then 1000 a month, making it impossible to rent a home in any 
traditional way. I spent 2 weeks thinking I was going to be homeless and
 lose every possession I own 2 days before Xmas
I found some people who wanted a room mate and was able to 
convince them to allow me to move in without a deposit or first months 
rent. My rent will be 80% of my month income. Leaving me literally, 
nothing else to spend on anything else I need. Food, phone, 
transportation. All of it.
I'm happy to not be homeless, but I spent Xmas essentially alone 
In a house with strangers who are living their lives as normal, 
surrounded by boxes and hefty bags and repeating to myself that death 
isn't an option, even if I can't think of a good reason why not right 
now(please no "suicide bad, good job" replys if you mind)
I suffer from bipolar 2, depression and several anxiety disorders 
in addition to seasonal depression, stacked with winter holiday PTSD.
It's a dreary and hopeless as it's ever been and I'm neck deep in it.
[[deleted]]: I spent it at home, it's definitely not something I find nice right now.

I recently saw someone who was from the US but lived in Mexico for
 10 years say that there’s an atmosphere of hopelessness and isolation 
here in the states they could feel in the air
Fuck you I got mine mentality works great until you lose yours and get fucked.
Or see others who did.
It has to affect them personally to notice.
Meh, not always. Trust me, as someone who did have parents who 
lived comfortably I did not notice what others went through as a kid and
 was able to develop some empathy and frankly it made me more liberal 
leaning the older that I got. Same thing with seeing some of the other 
kids who were sick in the hospital and volunteering. Sure, I've worked 
minimum wage jobs, too, but that didn't have as much of an impact on me.
 Even though my parents are comfortable, doesn't mean that some of my 
siblings aren't on medicaid because of having cancer when they were 
younger. I guess you could say that that would affect me personally, but
 even if it hadn't I don't think I would be much of a different person. 
When I was younger, there were times that I had to share my food with 
other kids because they couldn't afford to eat lunch and knew other kids
 who depended on the free and reduced lunches and breakfasts to not 
starve and certain politicians wrote a bill that would get rid of that. I
 knew other kids like them, too. (My family is more working class/upper 
middle class themselves for my area (so not much) and when I was 
younger, we were middle class.) I know people who did go from poor to 
upper middle class and they have that fuck yours I got mine attitude 
too, though.
A large part of that might be car dependent infrastructure. We transformed our landscape I to a depressing Grey nothing
"why dont kids ride bikes anymore" cops get called on them even when they do nothing
"why dont kids play outside anymore" maybe bc they're gonna scrape
 their knees a million times bc of how much concrete and less 
grass/parks there are
Because it's not safe for them to be outside alone and most 
parents are too busy working excessive hours to make ends meet and 
trying to maintain a home to just go outside for hours everyday.
I used to go out alone all the time as a.kid and I don't think 
anything is actually less safe now people are just more afraid
i think it depends on the area some people live in. some places 
aren’t as safe as they used to be because low life criminals have been 
moving/getting kicked out of their homes and moving to other 
neighborhoods.
But the parents mindset has changed I don't ever see kids out in 
my town but I don't see it being any more dangerous from when I was a 
kid.
Idk man. Maybe rural places are fine but i moved into a bigger 
town and the last few years i cant even walk on the sidewalk without 
someone nearly running me over. If it scares me as an adult, i cant 
imagine how kids feel having to be defensive of the drivers instead of 
the other way around.
It's much more than that. The cost of living hasnt increased in 
proportion to average wages for almost 50 years now. This created an 
environment where future generations will progressively do worse than 
their predecessors. Nevermind social media has created a super ficial 
inferior environment to socialize. Therefore younger people are facing 
more stress with less community support.
Of course, I just mean if they feel itjust by being herethat may be a large part
It at once liberated people to see places they've never seen 
before and sealed the doors for outside spaces of future generations
The amount of people that I know who want out, not even of 
Florida, but the country entirely, is way too high. I'm 35 and there 
hasn't been a time in my adult life that has been even slightly stable. 
The people I know who have families have a ton of help from their 
parents. Everyone else doesn't want kids or can't afford to. No one can 
afford rent, can barely afford a car, can't afford $14 drinks at a bar, 
their social lives have gone down the drain because everything is too 
expensive. There is no real positive outlook in this country. Things 
aren't bad, yet, like really bad. Everyone sees the writing on the wall 
and wants to get the hell out before it really comes undone.
I can't imagine how shitty it must be for the younger generations 
who didn't even grow up with a stable childhood. The financial crisis of
 '08 fucked a ton of people over and that generation of kids watched 
their parents struggle. They became adults and are doing just as bad if 
not worse. There has been no hope for them in their life.
It feels like so many activities now are just pure escapism or poor coping mechanisms.
Yea. This pretty much right here.
I remember in the 80's we went out at least twice a month for a big family outing.
Bells amusement park, in Tulsa or Big Splash and we had the public
 pool in the summer as well. We had the indoor fun fair and those 
traveling fairs that would come through town.
My father was A Captain D's manager and we were able to do this 
plus go to the Skating Rink or Bowl. We went to Tahlequah and went down 
the river several times a year. And my dad worked in a Failing Fast Food
 Fish place - and we could still do these things.
Then in the early 2k's I start hearing financial advice about how 
people shouldn't be going and doing these things and feeling so entitled
 about it
THEN A FEW YEARS LATER
*Is Blah Blah generation KILLING Applebee's??"
They tell people not to eat out, that it is entitled - then they 
bitch cause all these "third places" these business are going down 
because "To save money you shouldn't do it"
They will offer any solution at all - Except pay people
People aren't making families any more? Because they cant afford 
Families? FUCK - better take away family planning altogether then.
They will use any other solution that does not involve paying a living wage. Include taking away your rights.
Then there is the fees. Late fees. Processing fees. ATM fees. Fees
 to pay the Fees. Income tax is nearly (40) FORTY PERCENT
So you are underpaid - You get FEE'd to death just to USE your money that they have already taxed NEARLY HALF OF.
An nowpay at the pump is AKSING FOR A TIP!!
Oh - I'm getting mad just writing about it.
I hate this planet

Yes I grew up in guamuchil Sinaloa and evry kid plays outside over

I would guess the biggest cause to be social media and the internet. More connected, yet lonelier than ever.
If you're physically near, you get pushed away. If you're physically far you get pulled together.
This is what the issue is. Everyone is just lonely and conditioned
 to think social media followers are a substitute for genuine human 
connection. They're conditioned to avoid genuine human connection in 
favor of social media popularity.
We live in a sad world.
Not to mention the internet. They are the first ones to grow up 
wth the world's information at their fingertips, and they fucked 
themselves up with it
Increasing competition for everything
From bullyingto financial issues.
One problem - we're trying to solve national issues as individuals.
An economic system that produces negative results for a significant percentage of its participantsmightbe suboptimal and subject to improvement. But say that out loud and people act like you're the second incarnation of Stalin.

"why dont kids play outside anymore" maybe bc they're gonna scrape
 their knees a million times bc of how much concrete and less 
grass/parks there are
Because it's not safe for them to be outside alone and most 
parents are too busy working excessive hours to make ends meet and 
trying to maintain a home to just go outside for hours everyday.
I used to go out alone all the time as a.kid and I don't think 
anything is actually less safe now people are just more afraid
i think it depends on the area some people live in. some places 
aren’t as safe as they used to be because low life criminals have been 
moving/getting kicked out of their homes and moving to other 
neighborhoods.
But the parents mindset has changed I don't ever see kids out in 
my town but I don't see it being any more dangerous from when I was a 
kid.
Idk man. Maybe rural places are fine but i moved into a bigger 
town and the last few years i cant even walk on the sidewalk without 
someone nearly running me over. If it scares me as an adult, i cant 
imagine how kids feel having to be defensive of the drivers instead of 
the other way around.
It's much more than that. The cost of living hasnt increased in 
proportion to average wages for almost 50 years now. This created an 
environment where future generations will progressively do worse than 
their predecessors. Nevermind social media has created a super ficial 
inferior environment to socialize. Therefore younger people are facing 
more stress with less community support.
Of course, I just mean if they feel itjust by being herethat may be a large part
It at once liberated people to see places they've never seen 
before and sealed the doors for outside spaces of future generations
The amount of people that I know who want out, not even of 
Florida, but the country entirely, is way too high. I'm 35 and there 
hasn't been a time in my adult life that has been even slightly stable. 
The people I know who have families have a ton of help from their 
parents. Everyone else doesn't want kids or can't afford to. No one can 
afford rent, can barely afford a car, can't afford $14 drinks at a bar, 
their social lives have gone down the drain because everything is too 
expensive. There is no real positive outlook in this country. Things 
aren't bad, yet, like really bad. Everyone sees the writing on the wall 
and wants to get the hell out before it really comes undone.
I can't imagine how shitty it must be for the younger generations 
who didn't even grow up with a stable childhood. The financial crisis of
 '08 fucked a ton of people over and that generation of kids watched 
their parents struggle. They became adults and are doing just as bad if 
not worse. There has been no hope for them in their life.
It feels like so many activities now are just pure escapism or poor coping mechanisms.
Yea. This pretty much right here.
I remember in the 80's we went out at least twice a month for a big family outing.
Bells amusement park, in Tulsa or Big Splash and we had the public
 pool in the summer as well. We had the indoor fun fair and those 
traveling fairs that would come through town.
My father was A Captain D's manager and we were able to do this 
plus go to the Skating Rink or Bowl. We went to Tahlequah and went down 
the river several times a year. And my dad worked in a Failing Fast Food
 Fish place - and we could still do these things.
Then in the early 2k's I start hearing financial advice about how 
people shouldn't be going and doing these things and feeling so entitled
 about it
THEN A FEW YEARS LATER
*Is Blah Blah generation KILLING Applebee's??"
They tell people not to eat out, that it is entitled - then they 
bitch cause all these "third places" these business are going down 
because "To save money you shouldn't do it"
They will offer any solution at all - Except pay people
People aren't making families any more? Because they cant afford 
Families? FUCK - better take away family planning altogether then.
They will use any other solution that does not involve paying a living wage. Include taking away your rights.
Then there is the fees. Late fees. Processing fees. ATM fees. Fees
 to pay the Fees. Income tax is nearly (40) FORTY PERCENT
So you are underpaid - You get FEE'd to death just to USE your money that they have already taxed NEARLY HALF OF.
An nowpay at the pump is AKSING FOR A TIP!!
Oh - I'm getting mad just writing about it.
I hate this planet

Yes I grew up in guamuchil Sinaloa and evry kid plays outside over
 here. The suburban life here is so bleak and lifeless when I moved to 
Avondale Arizona there were hardly any kids playing outside
[Sufficient-Law-6622]: Fuck you I got mine mentality works great until you lose yours and get fucked.
Or see others who did.
It has to affect them personally to notice.
Meh, not always. Trust me, as someone who did have parents who 
lived comfortably I did not notice what others went through as a kid and
 was able to develop some empathy and frankly it made me more liberal 
leaning the older that I got. Same thing with seeing some of the other 
kids who were sick in the hospital and volunteering. Sure, I've worked 
minimum wage jobs, too, but that didn't have as much of an impact on me.
 Even though my parents are comfortable, doesn't mean that some of my 
siblings aren't on medicaid because of having cancer when they were 
younger. I guess you could say that that would affect me personally, but
 even if it hadn't I don't think I would be much of a different person. 
When I was younger, there were times that I had to share my food with 
other kids because they couldn't afford to eat lunch and knew other kids
 who depended on the free and reduced lunches and breakfasts to not 
starve and certain politicians wrote a bill that would get rid of that. I
 knew other kids like them, too. (My family is more working class/upper 
middle class themselves for my area (so not much) and when I was 
younger, we were middle class.) I know people who did go from poor to 
upper middle class and they have that fuck yours I got mine attitude 
too, though.

[Ximerous]: I would guess the biggest cause to be social media and the internet. More connected, yet lonelier than ever.
If you're physically near, you get pushed away. If you're physically far you get pulled together.
This is what the issue is. Everyone is just lonely and conditioned
 to think social media followers are a substitute for genuine human 
connection. They're conditioned to avoid genuine human connection in 
favor of social media popularity.
We live in a sad world.

[radiantskie]: Increasing competition for everything

One problem - we're trying to solve national issues as individuals.
An economic system that produces negative results for a significant percentage of its participantsmightbe suboptimal and subject to improvement. But say that out loud and people act like you're the second incarnation of Stalin.
[[deleted]]: Please please please don't give up, I'm 40 and a millennial and I 
understand all your frustration, personally I'll be lucky to live past 
60 due to family genes as all women in my family pass in their 60's and 
this haas always held true.
You are loved and wanted the world of today may be completely 
different in a few years, I personally cannot have children due to 
illness but it breaks my heart to hear thoses of you with so much ahead 
giving up, just hang in there, ALL of you please!
While I appreciate your concern I'm only 20 and and still have 
some hope things will change at some point, it's just I'm hoping it 
happens before I've blown through my youth, I see no point in living to 
be old if I'm lonely.
Whats funny is I was in that stage at 20... now 24 and working and
 nothing has changed. Hang in there for this? This is not worth it at 
all. Id rather quit work, sell everything, have a good couple years 
doing what I want and calling it quits. I know I am doing the opposite 
to help you but I also do not want to lie to you, it just gets harder 
and more frustrating.
I will say though the one thing I have not dived into too much is 
love and dating. It seems like that truly is one thing that will change 
your outlook because all your purposes will change. I am not sure of 
that but based on my parents happiness it seems to be the only one that 
works!
As a 23 year old I feel this. It’s like I have this constant void 
and the only thing that fills it is my shopping addiction. Every-time I 
leave my house I feel climate change and see a bunch of homeless people.
 What’s there to be excited about anymore? A 9-5 💀✋🏻 puhlease. Your 
comment really hits different.
I understand, I lost a majority of my youth to illness, but hang in there ok, we are all in this together.
it doesn’t feel like it
As somebody that's turning 30 this year, 20 is the very start of adult life for most. Thingswillimprove! It tends to accelerate the closer you get to 30.
I don’t man I’m 25 and my life has gotten progressively worse. Got
 shafted as a kid with the 08 recession and now with this it feels like 
I’ve been cheated out of the social contract. What’s the point in work 
if everything that was achievable by your parents (adult milestones) is 
now completely unaffordable and off the table.
My life at 20 and my life at 40 could not be more different. At 20
 I was working blue collar jobs, no real prospects, rampant substance 
and alcohol use, in terrible debt, and generally just miserable.
Fast forward two decades and some change and I’m the healthiest 
I’ve ever been, with a loving wife and kids, a job I love, and an income
 level most people dream of. I know it can seem bleak but it only takes 
one smart move or good choice to start an avalanche of good things 
headed your way. Don’t get up, don’t close the door permanently on a 
chance at living a life you love.
Hang in there for what?

[ZookeepergameThen363]: Hang in there for what?
[iqueefkief]: can’t even live for having kids anymore, it’s so expensive and overpopulated. what is the point
Yeah I've thought about that too. I'd at least like to raise some 
kids even if they aren't biological, like adopting or becoming a step 
father, at least watching out and raising them would give my life some 
purpose and fulfillment.

[Marxist20]: It's not life in and of itself that's pointless and unfair, it's 
life under capitalism that makes it pointless and unfair for the vast 
majority of people.
Nah life was pretty much just as unfair even when we were living 
in caves, but yeah this 2nd gilded age we're living in doesn't help much
 either.

[MangaMan445]: The suicide rates and depression have been trending higher since 
2006 when social media got bigger with Facebook and Twitter. Then it got
 even larger with the onset of smartphones in the late 2000s. It's been 
going higher each year. Social media and smartphones have definitely 
cooperated to the vast majority of the suicide rate. Everything else 
you've said is just fuel on the already burning fire. But the core of it
 is definitely how society has changed since 2006.
I would also add that it’s hard to find good long term care for 
mental health issues. For example, Florida has a law that allows someone
 going through a mental health crisis to be taken (against their will I 
believe) to a crisis center for 72 hours. Yup, just three days to try to
 work through whatever you’re going through. After that your put back 
out on the street again to fend for yourself. Just in general there 
aren’t enough resources for those in need of help.
TBF that hold isn't "To work through your issues" it's to keep you
 away from any means to off yourself for a set period of time till the 
urge passes.  Studies have shown that the time between deciding to end 
yourself and trying to carry it out takes place within minutes.
I agree with this. Social media is pretty much an alternative 
reality at this point that is like perpetually living in a commercial 
designed to make you feel inadequate, outraged, neurotic, and mentally 
fatigued.
Housing prices are out of control which is making adults 
stall out on pursuing “the American dream”, and if there’s no grand 
incentive for your labor outside of the meaningless consumption of mass 
produced trinkets, people are going to stop caring real quick.
Safety nets are diminishing
The societal contract is broken in so many ways nowadays, that it’s making people nihilistic.
It feels like there’s hardly a sense of tangible community 
these days which would have seemed foreign a decade ago.
I don’t feel that any of our political leaders are either 
competent or free of corruption, and there are no competent factions 
offering a better alternative, which makes me feel no optimism for the 
future.
There just isn’t a sense of hope for many anymore, and even I feel
 this as Millenial that had a late start, but has a decent career and 
can live (within reason) on my own, but also can’t seem to save fast 
enough to outpace inflation for a down payment on a house or responsibly
 start a family.
At 35 in 2024, life truly does feel meaningless and empty. I can’t
 blame Gen Z for feeling the way they do.

[logicalobserver]: its not financial, America is still the richest country on earth 
with one of the highest standards of living.... by this logic people in 
3rd world countries should be commiting suicide at a staggering rate. 
The issue is social media, lack of connections to real people, and this 
non stop negativity that places like reddit constantly promote, and 
people dwell on all these problems because they are alone and isolated. 
There is also a trend of these tiktok psychologists who really do 
wonders on mental health as a whole, the old mentality used to be a bit 
extreme and unhealthy, ignore your problems.... stuff em down, and just 
move on and dont reflect.... no one is saying to go back to that, but we
 are now living in the exact opposite extreme,  every problem and issue 
people have is exaggerated beyond proportion, people self diagnose 
themselves with tons of mental issues, which becomes like a positive 
feedback loop, which eventually leads to pills and self medication. The 
real crisis here is one where a culture of pure materialism has taken 
over, people think there value is just in having pleasure and owning 
stuff that gives them pleasure, I'm not advocating a full on return to 
religion.....but you are not a bag of meat, your not just some stupid 
animal here for a couple years of whatever, you are special..... you 
exist, you are alive, you have a purpose, you can make your purpose, 
material possessions are not the end all be all of life, life is about 
the connections you make with people, life is about being uncomfortable 
and getting through it, life is about struggle, which makes you 
appreciate being comfortable all the more, everything ends.... 
everything starts again, you are not just some dumb animal.... your 
brain and your thoughts are uniquely yours , are precious, and you are 
indeed special.
its not financial, America is still the richest country on earth with one of the highest standards of living....
Americans live very precarious financial lives. They may have a 
home and food on the table, but it takes very little for all of that to 
disappear. An accident followed by a hefty medical bill can set one 
person back enough that they fallveryfar financially. It's 
not about how fancy your TV is, it's about the security of whether 
you'll have a roof above your head two, three, five months, years from 
now even if bad things happen.
but you are not a bag of meat, your not just some stupid animal here for a couple years of whatever,
One of the main principles of self-care is recognizing that you 
are a mammal with pretty straight-forward needs. If those needs are not 
met you will feel bad. Those needs are, in short, movement, enjoyment, 
nourishment (good diet) and relaxation. Those things can be in short 
supply depending on what your life looks like.
If you need to work long hours in a sedentary job, or a job with 
limited and repetitive movements, in a society where you can only really
 get around by car, you already lose "healthy movement". Enjoyment 
shouldn't be the cheap and quick dopamine boost. This is where social 
media comes in. Sure, I'm not saying social media/smartphones don't do 
anything bad. I'm just saying it's not the only thing. Nourishment - a 
lot of American food is just not healthy, which is in part a person's 
responsibility. However, we're talking about kids/teens here. I've seen 
pictures of school lunches - my heart breaks for the average US high 
school student. They are fed slop. And they're getting ads for food 
items engineered to be as addictive as possible, health concerns be 
damned, pissed straight into their eyeballs along with the rest of us. I
 really believe soda and energy drink companies should be forbidden from
 advertising at all. And finally, relaxation. We don't get to relax. You
 have to strive for excellence all the fucking time to become 6-figure 
Corporate Office Housepet #6278 or you'll just be another flex worker 
with barely any rights and even less pay.
It's not all about social media and spirituality isn't going to 
save you as long as corporations are allowed to pluck us bare through 
shitty wages and predatory business practices.

[RealJohnBobJoe]: I can understand economic conditions influencing the suicide rate 
but depression rates for younger people have been on the rise for a 
while before our current post-COVID economic situation so it feels weird
 to immediately say “inflation” when discussing the main reasons behind 
suicide.
The rest of this comment though feels misguided. Do you believe 
that climate change and the existence of mass shootings are common 
reasons for suicide. I find it kinda hard to believe that someone’s life
 is just going perfectly well and then after thinking about some wrong 
in the world they just decide to kill themself. Typically some more 
immediate issue is responsible for such actions.
Frankly, I just don’t believe the average person is committing suicide over reddit doomer talking points.
Do you believe that climate change and the existence of mass shootings are common reasons for suicide
I think it can be small parts that build up to it. I'm someone who
 lives with panic disorder. The constant repetition of "it's getting 
hotter every year" and climate change argument doesn't ease it. Neither 
does the idea I can go to a music festival, and someone will start 
shooting up the place.
The thing about suicide is, there's a build up. It's not just one 
day you wake up and hold the gun to your head. It's little things that 
keep building and building until you see zero hope. I've tried taking my
 life before, and it was a build up of things like I mentioned. It was 
the feeling the world around me was hopeless, terrifying, and I 
shouldn't even exist in it because I didn't see any positive in it. A 17
 year old just about to graduate, enter the working world, head to 
college- they could see everything building up to just feeling like they
 can't exist any longer.

[Blitzking11]: We are more aware of*waves hands at everything*. The 
world is not made for us non-rich people, and it seems more and more 
likely that the morons are going to vote for people who have no interest
 in preserving this beautiful planet.
That's going to leave us on a planet no longer suitable for us and
 lead to terrible things (whether it's war, genocide, catastrophic 
climate change, etc., etc.).
I've been on the brink before, and those were my big drivers, 
along with overwhelming loneliness and fear of not being employable in a
 "good" job. I'm good now, but I get where those people come from. It's 
better to fight and fail than to do nothing and quit after all.
well no, it is made for us non-rich people, just not in the way 
we’d like. instead of being able to enjoy life and everything we have 
and can have, we get a world of constant worry, loneliness, and work.

[Potential_Peace_3709]: As gen Z, I've had a theory about this for a while. I've watched 
countless friends fall victim to depression and suicidal ideation.
I think the broad scope is we don't get blissful ignorance. We 
don't get to pretend like the world's not dying, our government isn't 
corrupt and letting us suffer, humanity isn't absolutely monstrous and 
terrifying, and -small scale- that our families are perfect and happy 
and normal.
Every day we're exposed to the horrors of the world, there's no 
escape. And there's so much pressure on us to fix it or at least protect
 ourselves from it. And if we can't fix the world, well you at least 
have to heal from generations of mentally ill, undiagnosed, untreated 
individuals meeting, bonding, breeding, and making that illness worse so
 that you don't keep that line going.
The dread and existentialism is almost a constant for almost 
everyone I know and these seem to be the resounding broad picture 
regardless of the finite details. But it is just a theory cause I'm from
 the midwest so we don't have much outside experience or escape.
Nah you're completely on the nose here. People are realizing how terrible they are by nature and we can't handle it.
True. Gen Z has been cursed with the existence of the global 
network of information from a very young age. We were born into the era 
of the internet. Some of us don't even remember a time when it wasn'teverywhere.
I guess it's better that unlike the previous generations, we can 
know what goes on outside of our small circles, but it's very clear and 
true thatignorance is bliss.

[CathanCrowell]: Many, many reasons...
It's worth to be mentioned that we live in interesting time,  we 
are more aware of importance of mental health but still average society 
is downplaying mental problems. Also, sometimes is problem to find help.
I cannot find therapist, because everybody is incredibly expensive
 and even when my country has "free" healtcare they usually do not 
support therapist or just really bad ones. Sometimes I think the only 
reason why I did not commite suicude is cowardice. My friends and family
 do not know how to help me, what makes me angry when I have really bad 
day, but rationally I know it's not their fault. I often have to pretend
 everyting is okay, because I know that most of people won't understand 
and actually cannot help me.  I almost lost my best friend because there
 was time when I was dark hole, nothing more.
Fact is that often average person cannot do anything and find 
profesional help can be difficult, especially when you are young.
Hey, that’s terrible to hear. 😞 I hope you’re able to find help 
soon though. Maybe you have someone to talk to who can help you during 
your difficult times. In any case I hope you’re able to be in a better 
state mentally soon.

[[deleted]]: Because we were the generation of "unlimited potential" and "you 
can do whatever you want to do" then right as we get to the age of 
actually attempting to achieve those goals. Everything turns to crap.
Not only that but social media negative impacts and the lack of interpersonal connections are increasing. ..
Males especially are being left on the wayside because people are 
paying attention to themselves more and ignoring(either purposely or 
unintentionally) men and boys while increasing the societal pressures 
and expectations
It's tough especially now because guys don't know how or don't want to express how they feel.
The West is at an interesting crossroads because all the people in
 leadership roles are too old and sheltered to suffer the consequences 
of their actions and Millennials + younger generations are learning the 
state of world affairs at a much younger age.
It's frustrating to see my peers eat up the distractions 
perpetuated by the Culture War when they actively know the atrocities 
committed everyday by elites.
We are not so different, so when people think they are "smashing 
the patriarchy" by hurting the men in their immediate lives, I can't 
help but feel like it's hopeless. Yes there are bad men who deserve to 
be shamed, but there are just bad people in general.

so much it doesn't seem serious anymore. I think people don't realize 
that once you die, that's it.
That first part especially I think hones in on turmoil that can’t 
be articulated in this metamodern world, particularly this younger 
generation. Something in the late 90s was percolating, something that 
was felt but not grasped generally, then the early 00s, and 9/11, pushed
 the natural flow of that feeling into acceleration and people couldn’t 
catch up.
The result is something inchoate, an incompleteness around and 
within people that is yearning to be expressed and satiated.

[vindicstion]: Your generation sold the future for comfort so now we have to pay for the past.
[ASecretGermanSpy]: Shit parents, bullying, self comparison to folks on the internet, less human connection and nobody to trust
[[deleted]]: Let’s count the reasons:
Feminism - women have been taught to hate men, use them for foodie
 dates, cheat on them, divorce them and alienate their children, false 
rape charges, men are called toxic. Meanwhile, men have been disposable 
sex for all of history dying in wars, building society to protect women 
and children. Young boys know this now because of the internet.
Boys are treated like garbage in school. Girls are given special 
treatment and privileges. More scholarships exist for girls and boys get
 called violent rapists.
They don’t see any hope of a future with a woman. They have 
watched generations of men get divorced and their home taken along with 
their children.
Affordability- there is zero affordability for housing. Men cannot
 simply get a job at a factory and support a wife and kids.
Relativism - This is taught in schools that everything is 
relative. There is no important history, culture, only what you find 
relative to you. Subjectivism has taken over objectivism. This leaves 
them with life has no meaning or purpose.
DEI - Diversity, Inclusion and Equity - Boys are told they are 
white privileged males. Meanwhile, not everyone that is white, male is 
privileged. It is basically school supported discrimination, racism 
against meritocracy. You don’t get the job because you’re the best at 
the job. You get the job or scholarship because you’re a woman, black, 
etc.
These all make young boy’s especially feel what the hell is the 
point of life and why should I try when I’m considered privileged and 
actively and openly discriminated against in society.
I can’t remember more but this is good of enough reasons. You can 
thank Leftist politicians and school teachers, universities for 
corrupting a once Prosperous western society.
[NoAlgae7411]: Well apparently shit got bad from the start since 9/11 and generations before us screwed our generation up
[infornography42]: I think a lot of it is the general hopelessness of everything.  
From climate change and social issues, to financial constraints and 
rapidly increasing income disparity.
It is hard to be hopeful when the future looks so chronically 
bleak.  And if on top of all that you have depression or are dealt a 
particularly raw hand, it isn't hard to see why there would be higher 
rates.
[coccopuffs606]: My hot take as someone who works with Gen Z and Gen Alpha is that 
it’s because they’re not allowed to fail at the little things, so they 
have no idea how to deal with failing at the big things. They spend 
their whole childhood with their parents making sure they don’t mess up 
or really experience any kind of negative impact. Then they get older 
and into situations where their parents can’t rescue them, and they 
don’t have the resilience or emotional tools to handle their very normal
 screw ups.
[TheChickenWizard15]: My theory: zoochosis.
TLDR is that when you coop humans up in houses for long periods of
 time, force them into repetitive cycles of doing meaningless, 
unrewarded tasks, deprive them of natural physical and mental 
enrichment, and discourage healthy social relationships, they tend to 
develop mental illnesses and become really unhappy. Similar to how a lot
 of zoo animals will pace around their cages and show similar signs of 
distress.
I definitely feel like im going through this, and so do a lot of 
other people my age. I feel like now we're finially getting to a place 
where we can talk about it and it's affect on people's well being.
[smokekirb]: Fix it ? Well we’d have to fix the world and I don’t see the happening.
[NeilOB9]: Social alienation perhaps
[CollynMalkin]: Because the world fucking sucks and we’re tired of it. Is the long and short of it.
I don’t personally struggle with the desire to end it, but I can 
definitely see where it comes from. We’re screwed in every sense of the 
word, can’t get ahead on anything unless our parents already were (which
 is not the case for most of us) and we’re realizing that a lot of “the 
way things are” is horrendous and we face the backlash for trying to 
change it or speak out. It doesn’t work. And nobody wants to change it 
and we’re only just starting to be old enough to actually do anything 
about it, and yet we’re blamed for all the turmoil. We don’t make enough
 money, everything’s ridiculously expensive, then add to it facing 
backlash for things like LGBT, Nuerodivergence, generally deciding to do
 things a different way because most of us got fucked up by our parents 
and don’t want to fuck up the next generation the same way…
This is what a lot of us think about and worry over. And why many 
would choose to just end it over dealing with the cruel, greedy world.
[Remarkable_Paper2305]: The popularity of social media.
[[deleted]]: Social media constantly shows them people who are more attractive and wealthier (which probably means smarter too).
Then add the fact that non-medical degrees are worthless and if 
you don’t have a passion for something healthcare-related, you’re 
probably fucked. You’re either going to be a failure or have a job that 
you hate.
Also, idk why it started with Trump, but everyone also became so 
sensitive. Almost anything can be taken the wrong way and get you sent 
to HR now. I got in trouble on my first day at a new job for saying “I 
loved working with Japanese people at my last job.” (I was coming from a
 Japanese company with lots of Japanese employees….).
[Gurney_Hackman]: Too much screen time and social media.
I don't know why so many people refuse to accept the scientific evidence of this. Social media use causes depression.
[Theramennoodler666]: I’ve been and am still close to calling quits due to financial reasons. Constant beauty standards, social isolation, etc.

TÍTULO: Why I Think Gen Z is Basically Dying Inside : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Gen z here
Honestly, it’s not just me. Gen Z is growing up in a world that’s actively crushing us. Look at the reality we inherit:
•	Economic crisis: Rent keeps going up, student loans pile up, and
 entry-level jobs barely pay enough to live. My friend just graduated 
with honors and is stuck delivering food because nothing else pays.
•	Corrupt or failing governments: Policies favor corporations over
 people. Climate bills get delayed while billionaires dodge taxes. You 
start realizing no one is fighting for your future.
•	Global instability: Conflicts everywhere, nuclear threats, and 
wars that feel like they could start any day. It’s impossible to feel 
safe or plan ahead.
•	Housing impossible: Even if you work 40 hours a week, you still 
can’t afford your own place in most cities. Many of us will live with 
parents well into our 30s.
•	Education is devalued: You go through years of school, spend 
tens of thousands on college, and still struggle to get a decent job. A 
degree no longer guarantees stability.
•	Mental health crisis: Anxiety, depression, burnout… it’s 
everywhere. Therapy is expensive, and support systems are overloaded.
•	Climate change: Fires, floods, extreme weather. We know the 
planet might not be habitable in a few decades, and we can’t ignore it.
I don’t want to live in a world of you will own nothing and be “happy”
Edit: also inflation: Saving for anything is pointless. Investing?
 Even worse. Everything is overpriced, rigged, and controlled by boomers
 who’ve been gaming the system for decades. No matter how hard you try, 
the rules are stacked against you, and the future they promised doesn’t 
exist.
Edit 2: As a summary of the post, Our parents and grandparents had
 a house, a car, and family holidays by 25. We have debt, anxiety, and 
four roommates by 25. Or in other words, we need to work ten times or 
more to get the same or less than previous generations, that’s the 
problem.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Beyond-Salmon]: Sure pal 🤣
Honestly hes not that wrong. All of US yapping but noone doing shit to change anything.
Gotta start somewhere. The more we yap, the more likely we are to organize and take arms
Weve been yapping for 5000 years
And no revolutions have ever happened in that time span?
And how many of those revolutions turned into even worse dictatorships?
well, who’s fault typically is that?
Usually the leadership of the Revolution that May start with good 
Intentions, but personalitys that are good Leaders tend to be easily 
corrupted.
Stop larping bro all of your comforts would immediately disappear 
if a revolution were to happen and you better hope your side wins

[basedbranch]: No one riots anymore...
Yes we do lol
Last time was like 3 months ago, and that was over so quick ppl 
forgot about it within a week. BLM was the last major wave of real, 
continous, tense rioting that actually challenged the establishment, and
 that was 5 years ago. So no, no one riots anymore.
People need to have dedicated goals when they protest. I have no idea what the BLM protests tried to accomplish.
The riots were even dumber and probably hurt the cause more than it helped.
This is the story of literally every protest since the occupy 
movement. We all know what people want, but a movement has to have clear
 and tangible goals to actually accomplish something. Protest with the 
specific goal of "Qualified Immunity Must End", and you might get 
something done. But a protest of just "we dont like how racist yall are"
 with no policy demands wont change anything
It’s been suppressed. Los Angeles music festival.
Lol protests arenotriots.
They can easily turn into them
5 years are nothing in the grand scheme of things. If no one 
rioted for 500 years you could say that we don't riot anymore.
Americans are much too privileged to engage in and endure real riots.
Eh, give us a couple years/ decades for things to truly get worse.
 It’s bound to happen eventually if our country stays on this 
path.
As long as people have entertainment, food, porn and the rest of 
their comforts, there will be no rioting. Not to mention that the 
government monitors all your technology so good luck organizing
Bread and circuses. But without the bread.

[Lambdastone9]: “Most efforts are futile” translates to “I think I’m powerless”
This is the most franchised era you’ll live in, even with all the disenfranchisement from this administration
A revolution will take all of that away from you, and make you a combatant. What power are you gonna have then??
[peeper_tom]: You dont wait for those, you make them happen
[TravelingSpermBanker]: People won’t have a revolution because things aren’t bad enough yet.
[Psychological-Mud790]: Don’t wait. Be the change you wanna see. I gained so much more 
hope, confidence, and optimism once I actually joined in on direct 
action :)
[[deleted]]: I need some of these big city motherfuckers to get it cracking. 
I'm tired of watching the country fall apart from Republican territory. 
There's so, so, so many people who are against this. We just need to 
learn how to organize.
There are organizers everywhere if you look.
[julmcb911]: There are organizers everywhere if you look.
[VoiceMasterTV]: It's taken too long for people to wake up and realize that if just
 20 million people out of the 380 ish million we have would just stand 
up and say no more we or we fight the government will bow. No army in 
the world can handle a 20 million person army. America struggles to keep
 up a 2 million man army and it's stretched across the world. Even if 
they are untrained they'd still be formidable. I think a big chunk of 
the numbers will probably be from military families. They didn't get 
involved in the military per se, but they do know how to handle weapons.
 Like myself.
[TrashManufacturer]: I’m waiting for the collapse.
[hailstorm11093]: It'll take a hell of a lot more to go wrong before there's an actual revolution.
[Lambdastone9]: “Waiting for the revolution”
Why…bloodshed, famine, nationwide deceit, division, lack of trust, desperation, depravity…
A revolution is just a war, but this time you don’t get to have a fully built government backing you up
Revolutions are the last thing you’d want
The war has already started. We just refuse to rise to the provocation.
[[deleted]]: The war has already started. We just refuse to rise to the provocation.
[Metamorpholine]: “If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution”, Emma Goldman
[OffModelCartoon]: Yeah because revolutions are achieved by waiting around for them.
[karl4319]: Millennial here. Went through 3 economic crisises, 9/11, the war 
on terror, the corrupt Bush administration the lied about Iraq, a near 
political revolution, the election of Obama, and I would say all before I
 graduated college, but the 2008 crash led to circumstances the led me 
to drop out of college for years before I went back in my late 20's.
Yeah, I really am waiting for the revolution too. I think the 
expected economic crash that may soon happen will be the trigger much 
like how the 2008 crash led to occupy wallstreet. I just really hope 
this time leads to real change. Obama was promising, but ended up with 
much the same as Hillary would have, and we needed more then and we need
 a whole lot more now. Pretty sure Trump is going to kick the bucket 
before the end of the year too based on current health rumors. That plus
 a crash should make the environment ripe for true revolution.
I think exactly like you. I also think a brutal recession like 
2008 is coming. Debt is insane, wages are stagnant, prices keep 
climbing… and this time it could hit even harder. It’s not paranoia, 
it’s just looking at the numbers and reality.
Yeah I’m shitting my pants about the next recession. They suck so bad
Yeah this one is going to be so much worse... In 2008, housing, 
food, healthcare and education were significantly more affordable and 
pay was relatively higher. Many people who lost their jobs then had a 
cushion.Most people today do not. With the higher cost of living when 
people lose their jobs they will be homeless in weeks this time....not 
months like 2008.
Time for some new deal policies!
We had a hoover before a roosevelt
The older you get the more you realize that there is always a 
recession looming ( if you're paying attention ), a war brewing, a 
tragedy to be upset over, people dying from disease, ... the reality is 
if you're waiting for the "right moment" you will forever be paralyzed 
with something on the horizion.
At the end of the day you just have to live your life and save for
 the future even if it seems silly. You will lose some you will win some
 and in the long term you will end up ahead compared to living on the 
sidelines.
"future", do you hear yourself?
Brother people have been waiting since Marx wrote the manifesto. 
People have lived and died believing the revolution will come any day 
now, and then their children's children's children's children are still 
saying "any second now it all comes crashing down and we can rebuild!"
Turn the tv off, or internet, and do something with the cards you were dealt. No one is coming to save you.
This person kept it frfr
What are you expecting to happen in the revolution?
Revolutions aren’t lead for the top.
If what you mean by revolution is the nordic model of mixing 
private and public industries with strong social services with some UBI,
 I'm all in. If on the other hand you are referring to a communist 
dictatorship, I'll have to pass.

[ChillEntrepreneur]: Honestly I think the world isn’t as bad as it’s made out to be. 
Media makes money off fear so that’s what we get fed 24/7. Focus on the 
stuff in your life you can control, your skills, habits, work ethic, 
ect. Ignore everything else. No politician is going to save you.
This sounds sweet but the financial realities can't be spun. I'm a
 millennial and i'm paying $30,000 a year so my two kids can go to 
daycare while my wife and I work.  We can't afford to buy a place so we 
are renting a house for $25,000 a year. We are literally paying a 
college tuition's worth of money so someone else can raise my kids and a
 second college tuition so I can live in someone else's house.
The media can "make money off my fear" that financially this life 
is not possible, because it's true. The narrative isn't selling because 
it's false, it's selling because it's true.
Outside of finances, the situation is similar.Two things can be true, our climateisgoing to shitandthe media pumps out climate disaster scenarios because fear sells.
No politician is going to save you.
Literally my boomer parents say this, especially when I ask them 
if the social security I've been paying into will be there for me when I
 retire like it was there for them. Literally the only person who can 
save this is a politician. I'm required to pay into it and they're 
supposed to pay me back lol.
These are the same boomer parents that bought a house for $95,000 
and sold it for $690,000. The ones who did that without having to pay 
for daycare, because my dad's job as a furniture salesman covered 
everything and paid my brother's and my college tuition. Meanwhile, I'm 
literally paying a college tuitionfor fucking daycare. While 
the billionaires get richer and the taxes on the wealthy vanish. I can 
"focus on my habits" (LMAO) as much as I want, but the reality is 
literallyonlypoliticians can save this. The thing we can focus on changing isthem, not ourselves. Fuck off.
You pay 55k a year in rent and daycare and think you have it bad economically?
Man.. most people's household income is between 50 - 80k
Presumably your wife makes more money working than it costs to pay
 for your kids daycare then, right? So compared to where many in 
previous generations had women stayed home to take care of kids you're 
coming out ahead.
And then once your kids get into the free public school system in 
like 3-4 years max you'll be able to put that 30k per year daycare money
 towards saving up for house payment within a few years if you want. So 
seems like you are squarely on the path to home ownership if that's what
 you want. Most countries in the world single family home ownership 
isn't even a thing at all. You have recent post talking about how you're
 buying the latest pixel pro phone model... It's just a little tone deaf
 to be complaining like this when you sound like you're in a much better
 position than most.
That’s a good point of view honestly
No, it's not.
Even if we were to accept that the world is that bad, maybe not 
for us who live in a western relatively safe enviroment, it is good 
advice to focus on the things we can control and cherish while educating
 ourselves.
Love some stoic philosophy here
This is the philosophy you try to teach people if you don't want 
them to change the system. When you say hey, this shit around seems 
crazy, like...how can I afford to live, because whatever the media says 
doesn't affect my financial reality, and what if the world is a Mad Max 
wasteland for my grand kids, because whatever the media says doesn't 
change the climate science data?
And they answer, "Nah bro, focus onyour habits" hopefully that raises a red flag and not an appreciation for an impactful philosophical point.
I agree with everything you said. Our generation has a serious 
issue with being a hivemind. Stoic philosophy is great for protecting 
someone's peace - ofc we shouldn't encourage someone to think about 
issues to the point it harms themselves.
At the same time, it's important to encourage those who are 
educated to educate others on the situation and push for standards and 
improvement - something only possible through criticism. It's a dark 
reality and uncomfortable to think about, but the people who are most 
uncomfortable are often the ones fighting for what's right. At this 
rate, nobody wise will ever have children because it just spells 
financial failure unless you hit it big.
Our gen needs to realize that a different mindset isn't an attack 
on your own. We all do things we're capable of to the best of our 
ability (or at least, we should. I hope you all have passion...). In 
saying that, I appreciate your comments, pasta, and pizza.

coming out ahead.
And then once your kids get into the free public school system in 
like 3-4 years max you'll be able to put that 30k per year daycare money
 towards saving up for house payment within a few years if you want. So 
seems like you are squarely on the path to home ownership if that's what
 you want. Most countries in the world single family home ownership 
isn't even a thing at all. You have recent post talking about how you're
 buying the latest pixel pro phone model... It's just a little tone deaf
 to be complaining like this when you sound like you're in a much better

[Entire_Emu_1671]: That’s a good point of view honestly
No, it's not.
[pastaandpizza]: No, it's not.
[Emergency_Routine_44]: Even if we were to accept that the world is that bad, maybe not 
for us who live in a western relatively safe enviroment, it is good 
advice to focus on the things we can control and cherish while educating
 ourselves.
[Apprehensive-Ad2087]: Love some stoic philosophy here
This is the philosophy you try to teach people if you don't want 
them to change the system. When you say hey, this shit around seems 
crazy, like...how can I afford to live, because whatever the media says 
doesn't affect my financial reality, and what if the world is a Mad Max 
wasteland for my grand kids, because whatever the media says doesn't 
change the climate science data?
And they answer, "Nah bro, focus onyour habits" hopefully that raises a red flag and not an appreciation for an impactful philosophical point.
I agree with everything you said. Our generation has a serious 
issue with being a hivemind. Stoic philosophy is great for protecting 
someone's peace - ofc we shouldn't encourage someone to think about 
issues to the point it harms themselves.
At the same time, it's important to encourage those who are 
educated to educate others on the situation and push for standards and 
improvement - something only possible through criticism. It's a dark 
reality and uncomfortable to think about, but the people who are most 
uncomfortable are often the ones fighting for what's right. At this 
rate, nobody wise will ever have children because it just spells 
financial failure unless you hit it big.
Our gen needs to realize that a different mindset isn't an attack 
on your own. We all do things we're capable of to the best of our 
ability (or at least, we should. I hope you all have passion...). In 
saying that, I appreciate your comments, pasta, and pizza.

[SuzQP]: Human evolution hasn't prepared you to perceive a visceral

happening in your own real life. I think you need to do a lot more of 
that.

struggles if they don't. We're actually pretty good at planning ahead

Not worrying about existential threats you can't control certainly
 reduces anxiety, but it doesn't change their reality, and some of these
 thingsareactually happening in people's lives.
Imagine if everyone did that in 1930’s Germany. Or if people just 
“pulled themselves up by the bootstraps” in the 30’s instead of 
unionizing?
Sometimes things are bigger than just you. Being selfish and purposely oblivious isn’t as virtuous as some think

[7LayeredUp]: It literally all boils down to economics. All of history can come down to economics for better or worse.
[digigyrl]: Gen X here. It's fucking crazy what's going on. Nothing is 
affordable. My belief is it boils down to greed. The "haves" vs. "have 
nots" and the gigantic income disparity that's going on. The margin is 
way out of control to where the normal people can't make it.
It must, and needs to change. Honestly, how many millions or even 
billions does anyone need? It's not necessary to have that kind of 
wealth.
More industries need a union revolution. That’s a big reason why we had an incredible middle class in the 50’s and 60’s

[No_Discount_6028]: Yes and no. Most generations have suffered through far more 
unfavorable economic and political conditions. It's obvious, however, 
that the Internet and its consequences have been a disaster for our 
generation in particular, and watching our civilization decline is 
psychologically difficult even if it's apparently declining to a level 
which is still among the greatest in human history.
also inflation: Saving for anything is pointless. Investing? Even worse.
This is bullshit. If you put $100 in the market in December of 
2019, it'd be $159 today, inflation adjusted. Over the same period, the 
value of a dollar went down by about 20%. So if you put $9,000 in an 
emergency fund that accrued no interest (which, you should be using an 
HYSA), it would still be worth $7,142 today, which would absolutely 
still help in the event of a job loss, for example.
I get that it's hard to save if you're in a financial pinch... but
 if you can, please for the love of god put some money away, for your 
own safety.
[DarknessGamers]: Just gotta find the right industry and stop looking at the world

I now own a house make great money and married.

[context_lich]: I understand the feeling and I feel it too to some extent and if 
you're just hoping someone other than you sees it, then I do. At the 
same time, I have to move forward. I have to live as though there will 
be a tomorrow and frankly as someone who's been living for a little bit 
and made a lot of mistakes: Things are often better and worse than you 
think they'll be. What I mean is that things are never quite as good as 
you hoped. The world is often dark and full of struggle, but things also
 haven't been nearly as bad as I feared either. I've made several 
mistakes I thought were game overs, but really just ended up being a 
different sort of existence. I move forward in my own way and there are 
things in my life worth enjoying still. I enjoy every meal. I enjoy 
listening to music on my many different long drives I have to take 
almost every day of the week. It's not perfect, but it's not the worst 
case scenario either.
[Legal-Ad-5235]: Something has to give right? 🥲 right? Like born in 2003, the good old days never happened for me 😅😂
[flipmangoflip]: There’s plenty of excuses for everyone in every generation as to

[Positive_Narwhal_419]: Technology really fucks with Gen Z too. Not enough in person

mentally
[Melvin-Melon]: Personally I don’t feel dead on the inside
[MacaroonFancy757]: The government won’t fix anything because it’s controlled by

When they pass, it’s possible voting patterns will change.
FDR did a lot after the Great Depression. We can’t just keep

ship
[MoonQuartzs]: We basically inherited the Millennials problems and more.
[caca-casa]: Well GenZ certainly didn’t vote like they wanted to improve their situations.
[hitlicks4aliving]: It’s all a scam bro the money is basically fake to keep us on a

[Intrepid_Passage_692]: Too much yap just go triple digits on motorcycle that takes care of my mental issues
[Rootayable]: I feel like this millennial sentiment, too.
[GoldenInfrared]: It’s social media.
Social media is to socialization what junk food is to nutrition; 
it fakes out brain into taking something that doesn’t actually fulfill 
our physiological needs because it’s easy, then we wonder why we’re so 
tired and depressed all the time.

Your reality is what you make of it all of these mental illnesses 
are in your head. The only way you can get diagnosed is through a 
questionnaire. You aren’t depressed because genetics or your 
circumstances you’re depressed because you feed urself garbage food, 
sleep poor, don’t exercise etc. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. The 
most well off people are often the most depressed stop seeing the glass 
half empty see it half full. Practice gratitude for a minute and I 
promise your life will be a lot better.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Sexy-MrClean]: I know you’re trying to help people but, I think you’re oversimplifying a pretty complex issue.
I think we over complicate a rather simple issue to keep people 
addicted to zoloft and spending thousands on therapy. We convince people
 that’s their mental health is out of their control and that takes away 
the control they do have. Instead of anxiety being something we want to 
cure it’s something they’re stuck with that needs to be treated. It’s 
just not true neither depression nor anxiety have any real basis in 
science
Okay sure, in some cases that’s true. However, to say it’s never a
 genetic or chronic condition is just inaccurate. I don’t say that to 
justify people giving in and being miserable their whole lives but, 
there are legitimate biological reasons someone could suffer from 
anxiety/depression.
How can it be genetic if the only way you can be tested for it is 
through a questionnaire? There’s no brain scan they can do that points 
out depression.
Because depression is measured by context. A “questionnaire” is 
inherently biased because you are self reporting. Therapists take time 
to listen to how you talk, your moods, activities, etc… so they can 
build a pattern of mood and behavior for you.
Nobody is diagnosed from a buzzfeed test, they are diagnosed by contextual analysis of your behavior.
No quite literally it’s the same test on buzzfeed that they ask 
you lol if you’re decent at lying anyone could get diagnosed
You had a shitty therapist.
Yeah they’re all in it for the money they just want u to sulk 
instead of fixing their problems. They make way more money if u come 
back every week why would they want to cure you when they could have 
your recurring income. They see us as nothing more than a $
No. You exclusively had a shitty therapist. Your therapist was dogshit. This isn’t an industry thing.
People suffer from a lot of things, what modern pyschology do is 
simply telling the painful patient to change the perspectiver of the 
world, offering moderate happy pills come with countless side effect. 
When medical industry interfer with people's cultural and social 
consiousness, how can you not expect the potential interes not getting 
people to "create" the patience that need to be treaded.
I mean we didn’t know cancer could be genetic for most of human history but, that doesn’t make it not genetic.
We don’t have a perfect way to test for it but, we do know certain
 genes can correlate to a predisposition for mental health issues. Not 
to mention doctors can usually identify behavioral traits which suggest a
 chemical imbalance in the brain. Having clinical depression isn’t the 
same as just being sad
I’m diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety and haven’t 
felt any sadness at all in years. I went to so many doctors and the only
 way they’ve ever tested is by asking u questions or filling out a 
questionnaire. Also if depression is something genetic that’s not 
curable then why have the rates of depression skyrocketed so much 
recently. Maybe our actions in the society we live in cause it more than
 anything else
Just because you’re diagnosed doesn’t mean you’re doomed to a life
 of sadness (because that’s not even what depression is). And I didn’t 
say it’sonlygenetic, you’re right that experiences can cause 
depression. The reason rates have shot up in the last 10 years has more 
to do with broader societal issues. If it were just poor habits alone 
you wouldn’t see such a massive societal shift.
Over the last 10 years we’ve convinced people living in the 
wealthiest, safest, least-disease ridden time in history that the world 
is ending that’s why people feel depressed. Msm wants us to think life 
is terrible when really we couldn’t be more blessed
Millenials and Gen Z are the first generation in modern American 
history to be worse off than their parents. I don’t advocate for having a
 “doomer” mindset but, you can’t be implying every reason young people 
feel concerned about their future is fake. People are struggling and 
people aren’t going to feel “blessed” when they’re struggling to keep 
their house, put food on the table or keep their insurance.
When people say it's genetic, they mean that some people have a 
genetic predisposition for it--that is, their genes make them more 
likely to develop depression, but it doesn't guarantee that someone will
 develop it. Depression has no cure, but treatment can make it more 
manageable, and with treatment it can start to go away faster than it 
would naturally. External factors can worsen depression, and seem to be 
causing the spike in mental illnesses amongst us zoomers. However, that 
doesn't mean that mental illness isn't real or that people who are 
struggling shouldn't seek help from a mental health professional.
Psychology and psychiatry are sciences and they're increasingly 
expanding our knowledge about mental health and finding effective, 
evidence-based treatments. There is an abundance of scientific evidence 
related to depression and anxiety--claiming otherwise is harmful.

 that’s their mental health is out of their control and that takes away 
the control they do have. Instead of anxiety being something we want to 
cure it’s something they’re stuck with that needs to be treated. It’s 
just not true neither depression nor anxiety have any real basis in 
science
Okay sure, in some cases that’s true. However, to say it’s never a
 genetic or chronic condition is just inaccurate. I don’t say that to 
justify people giving in and being miserable their whole lives but, 
there are legitimate biological reasons someone could suffer from 
anxiety/depression.
How can it be genetic if the only way you can be tested for it is 
through a questionnaire? There’s no brain scan they can do that points 
out depression.
Because depression is measured by context. A “questionnaire” is 
inherently biased because you are self reporting. Therapists take time 
to listen to how you talk, your moods, activities, etc… so they can 
build a pattern of mood and behavior for you.
Nobody is diagnosed from a buzzfeed test, they are diagnosed by contextual analysis of your behavior.
No quite literally it’s the same test on buzzfeed that they ask 
you lol if you’re decent at lying anyone could get diagnosed
You had a shitty therapist.
Yeah they’re all in it for the money they just want u to sulk 
instead of fixing their problems. They make way more money if u come 
back every week why would they want to cure you when they could have 
your recurring income. They see us as nothing more than a $
No. You exclusively had a shitty therapist. Your therapist was dogshit. This isn’t an industry thing.
People suffer from a lot of things, what modern pyschology do is 
simply telling the painful patient to change the perspectiver of the 
world, offering moderate happy pills come with countless side effect. 
When medical industry interfer with people's cultural and social 
consiousness, how can you not expect the potential interes not getting 
people to "create" the patience that need to be treaded.
I mean we didn’t know cancer could be genetic for most of human history but, that doesn’t make it not genetic.
We don’t have a perfect way to test for it but, we do know certain
 genes can correlate to a predisposition for mental health issues. Not 
to mention doctors can usually identify behavioral traits which suggest a
 chemical imbalance in the brain. Having clinical depression isn’t the 
same as just being sad
I’m diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety and haven’t 
felt any sadness at all in years. I went to so many doctors and the only
 way they’ve ever tested is by asking u questions or filling out a 
questionnaire. Also if depression is something genetic that’s not 
curable then why have the rates of depression skyrocketed so much 
recently. Maybe our actions in the society we live in cause it more than
 anything else
Just because you’re diagnosed doesn’t mean you’re doomed to a life
 of sadness (because that’s not even what depression is). And I didn’t 
say it’sonlygenetic, you’re right that experiences can cause 
depression. The reason rates have shot up in the last 10 years has more 
to do with broader societal issues. If it were just poor habits alone 
you wouldn’t see such a massive societal shift.
Over the last 10 years we’ve convinced people living in the 
wealthiest, safest, least-disease ridden time in history that the world 
is ending that’s why people feel depressed. Msm wants us to think life 
is terrible when really we couldn’t be more blessed
Millenials and Gen Z are the first generation in modern American 
history to be worse off than their parents. I don’t advocate for having a
 “doomer” mindset but, you can’t be implying every reason young people 
feel concerned about their future is fake. People are struggling and 
people aren’t going to feel “blessed” when they’re struggling to keep 
their house, put food on the table or keep their insurance.
When people say it's genetic, they mean that some people have a 
genetic predisposition for it--that is, their genes make them more 
likely to develop depression, but it doesn't guarantee that someone will
 develop it. Depression has no cure, but treatment can make it more 
manageable, and with treatment it can start to go away faster than it 
would naturally. External factors can worsen depression, and seem to be 
causing the spike in mental illnesses amongst us zoomers. However, that 
doesn't mean that mental illness isn't real or that people who are 
struggling shouldn't seek help from a mental health professional.
Psychology and psychiatry are sciences and they're increasingly 
expanding our knowledge about mental health and finding effective, 
evidence-based treatments. There is an abundance of scientific evidence 
related to depression and anxiety--claiming otherwise is harmful.

[Sorry_Sky_6663]: So you start by saying we're not depressed and then follow that by
 saying we are depressed and the reason is because we don't eat well, 
get enough sleep, and exercise. For anyone who really wants to fix their
 mental health issues, talk to a doctor. Don't rely on generalized 
inconsistent advice like this. And no you can't just "will your 
depression away", if that were the case it wouldn't be such an issue.
You’re not stuck with depression you just feel depressed and nah 
doctors are pill pushers who won’t you to feel bad forever. The reason 
why people don’t will their depression away is cause they’re told they 
can’t.

[ToValhallaHUN]: Nice "the problem is only in you" argument, bit it's one that is 
blaming an individual for systemic issues, which serves nobody but the 
status quo. I'll go an claim that most mental illness has nothing to do 
with the individual, they are totally valid responses for the sate of 
the human species.
"Mentally ill" people are some of the best people I've ever met 
and I'll go as far as to say if you're not mentally struggling then 
you're an ignorant conformist who either doesn't care about injustices 
and systemic abuse, or actively contributes to it.
I feel second hand embarrassment from reading your garbage opinion.

And the bigger part is that the “just go to the gym bro” mentality
 ignores how depression removes your willpower to do anything. You

The quickest way to cut inflation would be to cut all these social
 programs and cut government spending by about 90%. The worst thing for 
the middle class is medicare
Ah, so you’re a libertarian then. Fantastic, I’m sure companies 
wouldn’t suddenly jack up the cost of insurance knowing people have no 
alternative
If the healthcare industry was completely free of government 
involvement there’d be competition instead of government issued 
monopolies making it better and cheaper for everyone. You shouldn’t be 
allowed to patent life-saving medicine hell patents shouldn’t even 
exist. But yeah the free market incentives the best outcomes for average
 people
You know it’s the corporate health industry patenting life saving 
medication and not the government, right? The free market cares about 
profit above all else and is going to do anything to drive up prices to 
the extreme and without regulation they’d be able to do so. There’s no 
incentive for them to make the price reasonable, just milk people for as
 much as they can afford.
The government doesn’t have the same incentive to jack up prices 
for no reason and is at least partially accountable to the public.
Who enforces patent law?? The government... Also they don't care 
about profit over everything even the most famous rober baron of all 
time Rockerfeller slashed the prices of oil from 30c/gal to 8c/gal 
whilst paying higher than standard wages and controlling up to 90% of 
the market. The only real monopolies that hurt average people are 
government ones like recology and USPS
Who lobby’s the government to change the patent laws so they can privatize life saving medicine?
Rockefeller only did that to drive his remaining competitors out 
of business so he could acquire them. He operated low prices at a loss 
to drive out competition, not out of any sense of altruism to help 
people. And once they were gone he predictably shot his prices through 
the roof. If you legitimately think these companies have the average 
person’s interest in mind then I have some beachfront property in Kansas
 to sell you because you’d have to be a moron to believe that.
dont waste your brain. these people can’t think and they don’t 
deserve to. they don’t deserve anything but helpless mindlessness 
aimlessness. if you tell them how it really works they find ways to make
 it worse and be evil profiteers from suffering.

Rockefeller only did that to drive his remaining competitors out 
of business so he could acquire them. He operated low prices at a loss 
to drive out competition, not out of any sense of altruism to help 
people. And once they were gone he predictably shot his prices through 
the roof. If you legitimately think these companies have the average

[SavCItalianStallion]: Practicing gratitude everyday is a good suggestion. Eating well, 
exercising, and getting good sleep are also healthy and can help your 
mental health. However, they are not a magic cure. If you're 
particularly concerned about your mental health, seek out the help of a 
mental health professional. Social media is not a good place to get 
mental health advice. Influencers are not good to listen to for mental 
health advice--sometimes their advice is downright atrocious. If you're 
struggling with your mental health, seek out a professional's advice. 
Going to a psychologist has been a gamechanger for me--I feel the best 
that I have in years.
[Difficult-Catch2922]: With this post, you have the right idea. Feeling better starts 
with treating yourself better. Whether it be food, activities or thought
 processes. You can get this point across much more effectively by being
 less passive-aggressive or not acting like you're a better person(even 
though you may be).
I definitely don't eat the greatest and such, but I was diagnosed 
with many issues by the ripe age of 4, when I didn't even understand 
what I was diagnosed with.
Though I can recognize the issue of romanticizing poor mental 
health but posts like this invalidate peoples feelings or thought 
processes only set it back and make it harder for some to go forward
To be honest i do think invalidating your own feelings is good. 
Fake it til you make it yk even if u feel horrendously depressed 
convince urself to go out and put on a smile eventually you will feel 
better at least marginally
I do, other people don't, most people haven't been given the 
mental tools. I don't find that you've invalidated my feelings because I
 know they're valid just like everyone else's

[11SomeGuy17]: Most helpful and symapathic mentally healthy individual. 
Seriously, some of the least actionable, least useful, and most 
infantalizing advice we all hear 24/7 concentrated in a single post. 
Ofcourse depression is in my head, its a mental illness idiot, where 
else would it be? My fucking pancreas? Do you think your brain is just 
immune to issues?
"Bro, you're not blind, its all in your eyes, if you just try seeing things I guarantee you'll never need glasses again."
"You're not paralyzed, its all in your spine, just stand up bro, its not that hard."
"You're not deaf, just listen bro, trust me, if you listen you'll realize you can hear just fine."
But don't worry, you're not actually stupid OP. After all, its all
 in your head right? Just try being smart and thinking, promise it'll 
work.

[BiggMambaJamba]: You're just too ignorant and anecdotally minded to understand that
 praying wont save anyone, wether that trumped up kid with a magnifying 
glass standing over our proverbial anthill exists or not, or that the 
concept of other people having fundamentally unique experiences and 
perceptions of reality to your own is impossible. But jist because you 
cant understand it, doesn't mean anyone else's perception of said 
reality, or the truth of the reality itself, is any less valid. Ah, but 
hereninfindnmyself again, asking myself, what's the point in arguing 
with a vacuous narcissist who, because of a feeling in their chest or 
wherever generated by a chemical reaction sparking electrical impulses 
about a man in the sky, decides that they are helping people by 
projecting their beliefs, capabilities, and view of reality onto 
everyone else in the first place.
I find myself asking, again and again, what is the point of arguing with these people?
The answer? Not much, but here I am and here I will stay.

It's really frustrating when men share their experience of race 
and physical appearance being an issue in dating are often dismissed 
here as misogynist but he struggled with it too.
He would have been labelled inkwell and told that his personality 
is the problem but he's relatively the same person. Physical appearance 
and racial preference that makes dating life harder for ethnics is real.
Again, no one says it's women's responsibility but dismissing it is the issue.

[icemankiller8]: He’s correct but white people don’t care about this because it literally benefits them what do you expect
Do you want white people to feel sorry for you? Do you want white 
people to help you get a white girlfriend? Do you want white people to 
not date other white people until enough brown people get white 
girlfriends?
I am not sure what kind of response to this would communicate the sense of care you are talking about.
The dating sphere isn’t in some complete otherworld it’s linked to
 racial biases that people already have which is the wider issue.
It does not only affect white people and white women in the dating sphere either.
I can’t remember the exact stat but Asian Americans are more 
likely to marry a white person than an Asian or Asian American person 
for example that’s likely a consequence of growing up in an environment 
and country that says another race is more attractive and better.
Yeah, people tend to prefer to date within their ethnicity. With 
the exception that the majority of Americans see whites as more 
desirable partners.    Do you wish white people were more 
honest about their dating tendencies and to be more honest that other 
ethnic groups also tend to prefer whites?
You literally just ignored the stat I told you about a group 
choosing to not date within their own group and preferring white 
partners.
That is a consequence of pushing the idea that whiteness is superior that doesn’t only affect white people.
I don’t care that white people prefer to date other white people 
in general I care about races not being seen as superior or better.
I feel like it’s always known that other groups often prefer white men or women often that’s not a secret
I said the exception to people preferring their own ethnicity is 
that people in America tend to see whites as preferable dating partners.
 Forgive me if my wording made my agreement with your point 
confusing.
What can white people do so show that they care when it comes to dating preferences?
Right but that’s really my issue if a group is dating primarily 
their own ethnic group I feel like that’s normal and I would never say 
“oh don’t do that,” for any racial group white or otherwise, I think 
seeing whiteness as better also extends to seeing someone as more 
desirable or a better partner that’s where I think it is bad and shows 
racial biases which I don’t like.
How can white people show they care? It seems to me that you want 
white people to not date non white people and for the media to showcase 
non white people as attractive.
The point I think the guy is trying to make is that in dating most
 people usually tend to go for their own ethnicities as a norm, but 
theres this perpetration of non-white and non-asian (and by asian I mean
 Korean, Japanese, and in rare times chinese), races as "less 
desirable". Its not the fault of white people or non-whites but rather 
the status quo of media that usually supports the idea of non-white 
races as "unclean" or "other" in negative ways. For example you'd see 
indian girls specifically going for "only white men" because they have 
this idea that they're more 'civilized' and 'intelligen't. And you can 
also see the not-overtly-common but not rare case of white/asian folks 
who'd outright say "I'd never date a dark skinned/black/Indian person" 
while basing their opinions of stereotypes rather than people.
Hence there is also a struggle in the brown dating circle as a lot
 of them want to date white people specifically for social status or an 
inferiority complex, or a reverse vice versa where subconciously or not 
people would specifically avoid a person because they are brown/black.
Where do you see the media communicating this? There are 
definitely people who have these dating preferences, but I've never seen
 it in the media in the way you are describing.
Yes, that would be nice yeah, no.
How can white people show that they care when it comes to dating preferences in America?
For starters probably have more representation of asian american 
men in romantic leads in hollywood/media and shame/shun people who make 
racist comments irl/on social media about mixed race couples when the 
guy is asian or the woman is black.
Viewing castings and narratives like "the summer I turned pretty" 
with scrutiny for having racial undertones. Especially Jenny Han's work 
in general.
Most white people dont have any control of the media, so i don't 
know if there is anything I can do about that. I am not interested in 
shaming and shunning people in general, but I dont think it is good for 
people to speak in a dehumanizing way about others.
Easiest way is to be critical of or prefer to avoid consuming 
media that repeatedly presents racial stereotypes in favor of those that
 don't. And to call out friends/acquaintances if they make sus comments.
And one of those racial stereotypes is depicting a white man or white woman as highly attractive?
Like if there is a movie where s girl likes a guy, the guy shouldn't be white?
No but if you make like 3 movies in a row where the woman is an 
asian and has only negative experiences with asian male leads and then 
always dates/marries the white male lead in the end... that should be 
looked at with scrutiny.
And at pure random there should be a roughly equal amount of 
male/female minority romantic leads. It's sus when hollywood boosts 
asian female romantic leads and black male romantic leads over their 
counterparts.
I think they do that because of the interests of the majority of 
Americans. It seems like you want the media to make romance movies this 
way because you think that will change people's romantic 
interests.
How the hell does it benefit me? I gain nothing from any of this. How does any of that work?
If whiteness is considered more attractive and seen positively then it benefits them in the dating sphere.
For other races to be seen negatively in that someone has to benefit.
Mfw people in white countries are more attracted to white people

shaming and shunning people in general, but I dont think it is good for 
people to speak in a dehumanizing way about others.
Easiest way is to be critical of or prefer to avoid consuming 
media that repeatedly presents racial stereotypes in favor of those that
 don't. And to call out friends/acquaintances if they make sus comments.
And one of those racial stereotypes is depicting a white man or white woman as highly attractive?
Like if there is a movie where s girl likes a guy, the guy shouldn't be white?
No but if you make like 3 movies in a row where the woman is an 
asian and has only negative experiences with asian male leads and then 
always dates/marries the white male lead in the end... that should be 
looked at with scrutiny.
And at pure random there should be a roughly equal amount of 
male/female minority romantic leads. It's sus when hollywood boosts 
asian female romantic leads and black male romantic leads over their 
counterparts.
I think they do that because of the interests of the majority of 
Americans. It seems like you want the media to make romance movies this 
way because you think that will change people's romantic 
interests.
[icemankiller8]: The dating sphere isn’t in some complete otherworld it’s linked to
 racial biases that people already have which is the wider issue.
It does not only affect white people and white women in the dating sphere either.
I can’t remember the exact stat but Asian Americans are more 
likely to marry a white person than an Asian or Asian American person 
for example that’s likely a consequence of growing up in an environment 
and country that says another race is more attractive and better.
Yeah, people tend to prefer to date within their ethnicity. With 
the exception that the majority of Americans see whites as more 
desirable partners.    Do you wish white people were more 
honest about their dating tendencies and to be more honest that other 
ethnic groups also tend to prefer whites?
You literally just ignored the stat I told you about a group 
choosing to not date within their own group and preferring white 
partners.
That is a consequence of pushing the idea that whiteness is superior that doesn’t only affect white people.
I don’t care that white people prefer to date other white people 
in general I care about races not being seen as superior or better.
I feel like it’s always known that other groups often prefer white men or women often that’s not a secret
I said the exception to people preferring their own ethnicity is 
that people in America tend to see whites as preferable dating partners.
 Forgive me if my wording made my agreement with your point 
confusing.
What can white people do so show that they care when it comes to dating preferences?
Right but that’s really my issue if a group is dating primarily 
their own ethnic group I feel like that’s normal and I would never say 
“oh don’t do that,” for any racial group white or otherwise, I think 
seeing whiteness as better also extends to seeing someone as more 
desirable or a better partner that’s where I think it is bad and shows 
racial biases which I don’t like.
How can white people show they care? It seems to me that you want 
white people to not date non white people and for the media to showcase 
non white people as attractive.
The point I think the guy is trying to make is that in dating most
 people usually tend to go for their own ethnicities as a norm, but 
theres this perpetration of non-white and non-asian (and by asian I mean
 Korean, Japanese, and in rare times chinese), races as "less 
desirable". Its not the fault of white people or non-whites but rather 
the status quo of media that usually supports the idea of non-white 
races as "unclean" or "other" in negative ways. For example you'd see 
indian girls specifically going for "only white men" because they have 
this idea that they're more 'civilized' and 'intelligen't. And you can 
also see the not-overtly-common but not rare case of white/asian folks 
who'd outright say "I'd never date a dark skinned/black/Indian person" 
while basing their opinions of stereotypes rather than people.
Hence there is also a struggle in the brown dating circle as a lot
 of them want to date white people specifically for social status or an 
inferiority complex, or a reverse vice versa where subconciously or not 
people would specifically avoid a person because they are brown/black.
Where do you see the media communicating this? There are 
definitely people who have these dating preferences, but I've never seen
 it in the media in the way you are describing.

How can white people show that they care when it comes to dating preferences in America?
For starters probably have more representation of asian american 
men in romantic leads in hollywood/media and shame/shun people who make 
racist comments irl/on social media about mixed race couples when the 
guy is asian or the woman is black.
Viewing castings and narratives like "the summer I turned pretty" 
with scrutiny for having racial undertones. Especially Jenny Han's work 
in general.
Most white people dont have any control of the media, so i don't 
know if there is anything I can do about that. I am not interested in 
shaming and shunning people in general, but I dont think it is good for 
people to speak in a dehumanizing way about others.

[Artifact-hunter1]: How the hell does it benefit me? I gain nothing from any of this. How does any of that work?
If whiteness is considered more attractive and seen positively then it benefits them in the dating sphere.
For other races to be seen negatively in that someone has to benefit.
Mfw people in white countries are more attracted to white people

[Asleep_Flatworm_5884]: The guy is talking about his insecurities, please learn to read properly
[MeringueComplex5035]: It’s a  commentary on being brown, it’s not about woman it’s  about him.
[SirCadogen7]: I think it's more pointing out racial stereotyping and 
fetishization. He was talking about how brown guys like him were 
"exotic" and basically commodified when he was growing up ("they'd have 
to have a thing for brown guys."). Black guys have brought this up too. 
White women (white people in general) have a habit of fetishizing 
different races. For white women, it tends to be black and brown guys, 
and for white men it tends to be Asian and Native women the most.
He's not blaming anyone, he's pointing out the same shit non-white people have been saying for years.
Comment deleted by user
Absolutely, I was speaking in terms of the US. It's rather 
uncommon for minority races to fetishize other minority races here, it 
tends to be reciprocal (black men fetishizing white women, Asian women 
fetishizing white men), and not nearly as common the other way around. 
White women think all black guys are hung, basically reducing them to 
primitive sex beasts, white men think all Asian women are tight and/or 
easy/secretly kinky or in need of being dominated or shit like that. 
Meanwhile black men sometimes think white women are slutty, and Asian 
women think white men are the ultimate providers.
Still, here it seems to be most common for white people to 
fetishize other races. Just last night I was watching a reality show 
called Naked & Afraid (2 people dumped in a remote, inhospitable 
location with no clothes, a bag each, a map, and 2-3 primitive survival 
tools and told to survive on their own with only emergency assistance

Absolutely, I was speaking in terms of the US. It's rather 
uncommon for minority races to fetishize other minority races here, it 
tends to be reciprocal (black men fetishizing white women, Asian women 
fetishizing white men), and not nearly as common the other way around. 
White women think all black guys are hung, basically reducing them to 
primitive sex beasts, white men think all Asian women are tight and/or 
easy/secretly kinky or in need of being dominated or shit like that. 
Meanwhile black men sometimes think white women are slutty, and Asian 
women think white men are the ultimate providers.
Still, here it seems to be most common for white people to 
fetishize other races. Just last night I was watching a reality show 
called Naked & Afraid (2 people dumped in a remote, inhospitable 
location with no clothes, a bag each, a map, and 2-3 primitive survival 
tools and told to survive on their own with only emergency assistance 
from the crew for 21 days, before heading to an extraction point) and

change based on your opinion.
Just your thoughts, saw it in a video saying that gen z is the nihilist generation and I can’t say I disagree.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Distinct_Weird6906]: a lot of gen z is just realistic, not necessarily nihilistic. 
social media exposes more problems than solutions, so it feels like 
there's no point. but it's more about being aware of the issues and 
questioning the status quo. different from older generations who just 
accepted things as they were.
The only solution is revolution.
Love how everyone else is whinging in their own comment. ¡Viva la revolution!
Yeah I'm not fighting in your commie revolution good luck though lol
No one asked you.
Pessimists love to say they are just being realistic
thats what a nihilist is, realistic

[SummerEchoes]: Pessimists love to say they are just being realistic

[xena_lawless]: People conflate nihilism with depression.
If you're so beaten down that you can't generate the experience of
 meaning, you think there's no meaning in the universe.
Similar to people who don't have love in their hearts thinking there's no love in the universe.
But just because you're not experiencing it now, doesn't mean it isn't possible, or that you never will.
It's the difference between being beaten down for now, and being permanently defeated.
The first is more than understandable given how increasingly late 
in the Monopoly/Kleptocracy game the post-Boomer generations 
arrived.
The latter (being permanently defeated) is a fundamental misunderstanding of life and reality as such.
Be a realist, not a doomer.
[cantaloupeburner]: Lmao no
[deepeststudy]: The baby boomers were the nihilists.
[Spaghetti_Nudes]: Not caring and not knowing how to care are way different

Facts, it's horrible

I have the solution
[KerPop42]: Check out the Dadists in post-WW1 Europe. The world doesn't make sense anymore, so why try to force it to?
Nihilism was a major issue into the Depression as well, but was ultimately superceded by absurdism.
[Dan1lovesyoualot]: FUCK YESSS

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk

As I am getting ready to exit college, I have realized over the 
years that I am always at a crossroads: be selfish and not care about 
others, or be selfless and let others take advantage of you. As I have 
tried to be as morally positive as possible, I realize that unless a 
person is true friends to you, they will take advantage of any 
altruistic behavior. When I entered college, I found myself a person who
 would really do anything for the good of others, but as I left I 
realized that's not the way a person should live if they want to go far 
in this world, so I have turned into a selfish prick to avoid being 
taken advantage of.
I feel like I have become hardened and overall, a pretty bad 
person. If someone is not a close friend, I treat them no better than a 
stranger. It is sort of a defense mechanism to avoid being taken 
advantage of, because acquaintances can and will take advantage of you 
if given the chance. I've also lost a lot of friends who I realized are 
taking either advantage of me or look down upon me, and I realized if 
someone is even showing signs of a lack of loyal behavior, to cut them 
loose with no exceptions.
What do y'all think about this mindset? Is the world really a 
place where you must either take advantage of others or be taken 
advantage of? Have I just had a unique set of bad experiences I need to 
get over? Do I need to become a better person and change my mindset?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Careful_Response4694]: Life is not so black and white.
[ItsSadTimes]: You can be selfless without others taking advantage of you. The 
world isn't black and white. You may have been dealt some bad hands but 
that doesn't mean the game is rigged.
If you want to 'go far in this world' by being a selfish person 
who just wants to fuck over people and acquire wealth then that's gonna 
be a really sad and lonely life, think twice before going down that 
road. It seems like people doing that to you was what brought you to 
your current state. You wanna do the same thing to someone else?
You don't have to bend over backwards to be considered a decent 
and non-selfish person. It's the little things that make a difference 
and keep yourself sane in the fucked up world. Don't litter when there's
 a trash can nearby. Say thank you to service workers. Make a nice 
comment to a colleague. Just little things just so you're not completely
 shut off but you're not giving some acquaintance a kidney.
Plus, how can you make really good friends without starting off as chummy acquaintances first?
Absolutely hot take for the people here, but I agree!
I think becoming friends with people for me right now comes from a
 relationship formed on helping each other (classmates helping each 
other for homework for example) where being selfish WOULDN'T benefit 
either of us. If I have an acquaintance that has the opportunity to help
 themself by being selfish, one of us will absolutely take the 
opportunity. I agree though, and I think the little things you said are 
great things to do that I will try to prioritize
All of my college friends who I still talk with i didn't have a 
class with a single one of them. I just met them through some guy who 
lived on my floor who I felt bad for because he didn't have many friends
 in the dorm, like me. So I went over, played games with him, and he 
introduced me to his friends and bam, we're all best friends now.
We still have some moochers from time to time, but those are just 
little road bumps on our total friendship ride. So we work them out and 
move on together.
Cutting off pieces of shit from your life is a perfectly fine 
thing to do, 100%. But you should leave room to at least try and let 
some new people in to try them out. You'll never know, maybe you'll find
 a new best friend.

[Phantom_STrikerz]: You know that cooperating with other people can also benefit 
yoylurself? Most of the things in this world is not a zero-sum game.
Yes, there are plenty of situations like that, but eventually at 
some point there will be a chance to screw the other person over in some
 capacity
Do you know game theory? Tit for tat strategy is pretty effective and you don't need to be too selfish.

[Symmetrecialharmony]: Why think in black & white binaries? I can be selfish and put 
my self-interest first when needed but still overall do my best to be a 
good person.
The idea of a binary where you can only be completely selfish or 
be completely altruistic is just something I’ll reject outright on this
[[deleted]]: https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature
Lol, what? Please, educate us about the lost times then humans 
were not selfish. Because it looks like you are throwing around words 
and links without comprehending them.
I would say people are less selfish in more collectivist societies
 rather than individualist ones. That's more about culture than economic
 systems though.
Collectivist societies fail when they try to expand past a certain
 point because they fail to take selfishness and greed into account.
I just pointed out his fallacy. I’m not interested in improving his argument.
That's not an appeal to nature fallacy
Username checks out.
I don’t think you know what you just cited.
I didn’t make an appeal to nature, so idk how this is supposed to be a gotcha here.
You were the one who implied capitalism is the reason why there is
 so much selfishness in society. Literally all I did was point out it’s 
wrong to act like there wasn’t an abundance of selfishness prior to the 
advent of capitalism
This was a weird attempt at a gotcha tbh
Not at all is it the reason for these behaviors. These behaviors 
existed before the advent of capitalist modes of production and are 
maladaptive in other economic organizations. Capitalism just celebrates 
and promotes and rewards these behaviors.
Your attempt to characterize my argument so you could negate it 
(straw man) by recasting it as an appeal to nature only works if you 
believe that humans are selfish by nature (appeal to nature).
So you’re right. You didn’t JUST make an appeal to nature.
I didn’t recast it as an appeal to nature. The subject was on the 
OP’s perception that people are selfish and you have to be selfish (to 
varying degrees) in life in return. All I said was Your original comment
 & the person you responded to made it sound as though this 
selfishness exists in the world because of capitalism, which I disagreed
 with
Again, stop trying to use fallacies you don’t understand. If I 
were to claim humans are by nature selfish, that isn’t me making an 
ought claim, which is where an appeal to nature comes into play.
Your own link, funnily enough, debunks your weird attempt at a gotcha
“Many ‘natural’ things are also considered ‘good’, and this can 
bias our thinking; but naturalness itself doesn’t make something good or
 bad. For instance murder could be seen as very natural, but that 
doesn’t mean it’s good or justifiable”
A naturalistic fallacy on this would be me claiming being selfish 
is good because we are naturally selfish. I.e, we are selfish by nature,
 and therefore being selfish is good.
That’s an actual naturalistic fallacy. But just saying something 
like humans are by nature selfish, and capitalism isn’t the reason 
selfishness is prevalent in human society is not a naturalistic fallacy,
 there’s no moral claim or ought claim.
By your frankly weird logic here, making any statement about human
 nature devoid of any ought or should claim would be illogical via 
logical fallacy, which is absurd.
Don’t cite things you don’t fully understand here
There is no human nature. Your argument of human nature doesn’t 
hold water. OP lives only in capitalism so can only have that 
experience.
Why is it always the anime profiles?
That wasn’t the original complaint. You’d try to do a silly gotcha
 with a naturalistic fallacy, got disproven by your own link, and now 
are debating whether or not there is a human nature, when previously 
your argument was that appealing to an existing human nature is a 
naturalistic fallacy.
You can move the goal posts if you like, but at least acknowledge 
the fact you made an error here. In fact, claiming a naturalistic 
fallacy exists in your link only works if there is a human nature, 
because the fallacy is pointing to an existing human nature and 
supposing that to be morality, and obviously using human nature as 
morality can only be a fallacy if human nature exists in the first place
So either you believe an appeal to nature is a fallacy because of 
the link you sent (which presupposes human nature) or you don’t believe 
in human nature at all, which makes you posting your link look even more
 weird
And fyi, even if you don’t believe in human nature, it doesn’t 
follow that there is no human nature and therefore capitalism is the 
cause of our selfishness.
So this argument also doesn’t really help your original point either man
Also for the record, ad hominem attacks are also considered a 
logical fallacy, which is what you did with the anime profile stuff here
That’s an actual use of a logical fallacy, not what you tried to do earlier

An ad hominem would be if I said your arguments are wrong because you are a long-winded, myopic, debate bro.

in human nature at all, which makes you posting your link look even more
 weird
And fyi, even if you don’t believe in human nature, it doesn’t 
follow that there is no human nature and therefore capitalism is the 
cause of our selfishness.
So this argument also doesn’t really help your original point either man
Also for the record, ad hominem attacks are also considered a 
logical fallacy, which is what you did with the anime profile stuff here
That’s an actual use of a logical fallacy, not what you tried to do earlier
😃
An ad hominem would be if I said your arguments are wrong because you are a long-winded, myopic, debate bro.
I was just asking why anime profiles are always like this. Your arguments are wrong of their own (lack of) merits.
[Symmetrecialharmony]: That wasn’t the original complaint. You’d try to do a silly gotcha
 with a naturalistic fallacy, got disproven by your own link, and now 
are debating whether or not there is a human nature, when previously 
your argument was that appealing to an existing human nature is a 
naturalistic fallacy.
You can move the goal posts if you like, but at least acknowledge 
the fact you made an error here. In fact, claiming a naturalistic 
fallacy exists in your link only works if there is a human nature, 
because the fallacy is pointing to an existing human nature and 
supposing that to be morality, and obviously using human nature as 
morality can only be a fallacy if human nature exists in the first place
So either you believe an appeal to nature is a fallacy because of 
the link you sent (which presupposes human nature) or you don’t believe 
in human nature at all, which makes you posting your link look even more

[TrashApocalypse]: The cult of narcissism is winning the culture wars.
Well yeah, we live in capitalism. The cult of the self is what keeps it moving. Well that and exploitation.

[unlucky_bit_flip]: Capitalism is way more symbiotic than you think.
Parasitism is a type of symbiosis, sure.
Labor works, capitalists get paid.
Spoken like a person who’s never actually built a business.
Well yeah. I’m not a parasite. I’m not big on exploiting the labor of others in order to finance my own lifestyle.
The best entrepreneurs I know think just like you. People actuallywantto work with leaders who respect & value them, not exploit them. But you’re too married to ideology to see that, sadly.
Lay off the Marx vomit, this isn’t the 1800s anymore.
Haha, sure they do. Anecdotes are fun, aren’t they?
Profit is just unpaid wages. I’m glad that the mask of capitalism is slipping enough for people to see this more and more.
I’ll forgive your ignorance. You’re probably just a kid.
How do you explain yours? Just willful?

[TooObsessedWithMoney]: I had that mindset in my teens before realising it's what 
perpetuates the systems that makes it desirable and in some cases a 
necessity. Embracing a callous attitude though won't do anything to 
bring about actual change, it won't break the cycle of abuse humanity is
 stuck in.
Systematic issues require selflessness in order to be solved which
 can and will at times lead to personal sacrifices. The work that's put 
in though is meaningful and carries an impact which is what gradually 
helps create a better world in the long run.
[Slyraks-2nd-Choice]: It only requires you to be selfish if you have no concept of nuance.
[[deleted]]: Capitalism is what makes us all behave like individualized 
animals. Capitalism rewards the most greedy and myopic behavior. 
Capitalism destroys senses of community and sells them back to us.
[aefre9313]: Self-interest is the driving force for all living things
It's not. It absolutely is not.
If every living thing did that they'd die. Humans are 
instinctually attracted to baby like features like small, round, and 
soft because we evolved to take care of kids. Not even just our own 
kids, just babies in general. I can't bring my mother anywhere without 
her gushing over someone else's baby.
Just off the top of my head one example , outside of humans, is 
ants. They work as a full colony in protection of their queen and 
babies. They bring all food back to provide for the entire nest. Some 
ant species are literally suicide bombers with acid to kill invading 
insects.
I get it, you're down on your luck and upset at the world. That's 
typical sadly. But that doesn't mean that not giving a shit is a natural
 way of life. You should take some time and reflect on yourself and why 
you think that way. I'm being serious, get some help dude, that's really
 concerning.
Agreed. Some real "all edge but no point" takes being spouted in this thread.
Hell, even with humans I can think of many examples of our species
 going against our own group’s interests to help. Like there are so many
 skeletons with signs of diseases or disabilities that would’ve killed 
them early in their lives, but they lived well into adulthood because 
people in their group spent the time and resources to take care of them 
despite them not being able to contribute.
Humans are social creatures, and at our core (for most of us) we 
are altruistic, but the system we live in was created by people who want
 power and it’s so much easier to get that power through selfishness 
than it is through selflessness.
I genuinely dislike babies and know other but you got a point for the rest of it haha
But do you like cute things? Or at least notice things with cute 
features? Scientists believe that's caused by our nurturing instincts 
for our kids. Also kind of why we see lots of baby animals as cute as 
well.
In reality, having a baby comes with a LOT of extra baggage. 
They're germy, they poop constantly, and they're extremely fragile. So 
it's perfectly reasonable nowadays when people have more context of life
 that some people won't really want kids or to touch them.
The baby nurturing instincts thing is just a generalization, not a rule.
Ok fair enough!
People want to protect babies because it continues their genetic 
legacy (self-interest), or even for babies who aren't theirs, protecting
 them benefits society, which they're a part of. Benevolent acts usually
 have ulterior motives behind them, even if indirectly.
Ant and bee colonies survive based off the even genetic 
relatedness of every worker to the queen. When this is broken they start
 killing each other.
How could it be any other way? It would be total chaos if we, and 
every other living thing on earth, didn't act based on the default 
instinct to help ourselves. Could you imagine a world full of truly 
random actions?
You don't understand biology and have twisted this into some personal issue. I love my life
self-interest is the driving force in our current society…..

[tohon123]: self-interest is the driving force in our current society…..
[[deleted]]: not really, at least the way I see it is that you must look out for your own interest
but that doesn't mean being predatory towards others
which for me mostly boils down to clearly setting the rules (like 
what I am willing to do at work and what I'm not) then just following 
through on them without making exceptions or caring for emotional 
appeals
[[deleted]]: Why do you have to be truly altruistic and get taken advantage of, or be completely selfish?
It's all about striking a balance, learning from mistakes, and 
identifying troubling scenarios early on, then cutting people off when 
they try leeching off of your life force. Altruistic doesn't mean you 
have to abandon concern for yourself. Altruism is about compassion and 
concern, save some for yourself and set boundaries and respect them. 
That's how you best help others, not just by giving them what they think
 they want but by what they need, and that includes being someone who 
puts their foot down. You are part of the experiences they need to widen
 their scope on the world, and they are part of yours.
[Careless-Butterfly64]: No your not wrong at all. Trust me, one of the many things I've 
learned in my short life span is that you have to be selfish until you 
make it.
[ArtifactFan65]: You can be neutral without taking advantage of other people.
[[deleted]]: The world mislabels all the time. Selfish might be too extreme. 
Self-interested is totally normal. You need to survive and that means 
being self interested. Put yourself ahead of helping others so you can 
safely help others if that makes sense.
[Friedchicken2]: All people live their lives in the morally grey.
To live is to be somewhat selfish. To help others you first have to help yourself.
This type of thinking isn’t unique to capitalism, or any modern 
concept. For thousands of years humans have fought, broken bread, fought
 some more, bartered, acted selfishly, acted selflessly, etc.
I don’t personally live my life by declaring what kind of person 
I’m going to be. I just live it, try to be decent, and move on.
[[deleted]]: It’s okay to be selfish. It’s not okay to not be considerate of 
others, but it’s okay to be selfish. People always associate selfishness
 with poor behavior/in a negative connotation, but selfishness is 
necessary if you want peace, if you want to put your one life first and 
get what you want and enjoy it, be selfish.
I do agree that there's a difference, and I wouldn't say I'm 
absolutely inconsiderate of others. But I would rather be on the side of
 being inconsiderate than selfless in this world if I was to choose
[ElectionSalty6097]: I do agree that there's a difference, and I wouldn't say I'm 
absolutely inconsiderate of others. But I would rather be on the side of

[ElectionSalty6097]: I feel like my career will be my source of my long term legacy 
after I die, and I will provide value to society in that way. Not by 
being charitable to acquaintances that will take advantage of me
[GFEIsaac]: Welcome to the real world.  Don't let it turn you to stone, and don't let it crush you.
[MadNomad666]: Yeah. You need to be selfish for certain things like your friends,
 your time, your money. Be selfless in making friends, being happy, and 
not having guilt with your hobbies. The world is grey
[halapenyoharry]: You just have to watch out for users. you can be kind with out 
trusting people with personal information, money, or your time.
[BrotherLazy5843]: Humans in general are selfish in nature. That said, selfishness 
can lead to selflessness if someone's desire to feel good about helping 
others is encouraged and rewarded.
[GoomyTheGummy]: I realized this when I was 8. Life sucks.
[_ManMadeGod_]: Selfishness is often necessary. If you're emotionally exhausted 
and a partner or friend wants to vent about their own issues to you, and
 you deny them, you are being selfish. But selfish for self 
preservation.
People keep saying the world isn't so black and white. Yes it is 
and no it isn't. Everything is nothing and nothing is everything. 1 = 0 =
 ∞.
What I'm saying is, there's gonna be a majority outcome in every 
decision. Either mostly selfish or mostly selfless. Closer to yin or 
closer to yang. But you must find the right path. Be as selfless as one 
can be while knowing yourself. Know the limits and when to be selfish.
Oftentimes being selfish is paradoxically selfless. Is it a selfless act if done solely because it feels good to be good?
[Grumblepugs2000]: Welcome to the real world and the first step to becoming a right 
wing reactionary. The left views people as inherently good (hence why 
they believe in delusional concepts like Communism) while the right 
views people as inherently evil and selfish
And yet, historically, we’ve been able to overcome so much evil 
and selfishness because someone cared enough to make a difference.
Thank you very much, but I’ll stick with the left if it means I 
can be one of those who actually helps create those little changes that 
shape history.
For OP, you’re absolutely not wrong. However, the trick is not to 
be a jerk, but being a little selfish now and then doesn’t hurt anyone. I
 sometimes feel the same as you, but then I realize that trying to be a 
good and kind person has actually helped me a lot in my life.
Theoretically evil and selfish people could easily get along 
together as long as they are also intelligent and value their own lives,
 because humans have a much higher chance of surviving by working 
together rather than constantly fighting and starting wars.
Unfortunately that's not the case though.

[[deleted]]: Kinda longish (and broken up) quote from G.K. Chesterton that I think might be pertinent to this conversation:
“The swiftest things are the softest things. A bird is active, 
because a bird is soft. A stone is helpless, because a stone is hard. 
The stone must by its own nature go downwards, because hardness is 
weakness. The bird can of its nature go upwards, because fragility is 
force. In perfect force there is a kind of frivolity, an airiness that 
can maintain itself in the air… a characteristic of the great saints is 
their power of levity. Angels can fly because they can take themselves 
lightly... Seriousness is not a virtue… It is really a natural trend or 
lapse into taking one’s self gravely, because it is the easiest thing to
 do. It is much easier to write a goodTimesleading article than a good joke inPunch.
 For solemnity flows out of men naturally; but laughter is a leap. It is
 easy to be heavy: hard to be light. Satan fell by the force of 
gravity.”
[Opposite-Winner3970]: The instant the world forced You to be in that crossroad is the 
instant the whole cosmos, from the base up, deserves to be burnt in a 
blaze.
May chaos take the world.
Cringe
[ship_write]: Cringe
[Ok-Equipment-9966]: always take care of yourself first. So I would say be selfish 
unfortunately, it's what I've learned so far on my 28 years on earth.
[gucci_stylus]: it's ok to be selfish. we're all in this together but at the end 
of the day you where born on your own and will die on your own.
-satoru gojo
[[deleted]]: Well, fundamentally life is sustained on selfishness. The 
suffering of the prey always outweighs the satisfaction of the predator.
 To live we must take. You don't have to be that selfish to others 
though. In your case it sounds like a matter of learning to say "no". 
Don't want to be taken advantage of? Just say no, they can't make you do
 anything you don't want to (legally).

--- DOCUMENTO: Do You Guys Consider Most Gen Zers a Snowflake Generation _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: Do You Guys Consider Most Gen Zers a Snowflake Generation : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
The reason I ask this because I heard about most  young people  
nowadays just canceling other people for petty reasons or some things, i
 mean you guys know what's up, they also say some things what they see 
about that being offensive or this offensive eventhough it wasn't 
consider offensive, they have look enough to see if it big deal or not. I
 also watch some their videos about that too, and based on how 
disrespectful they acting after Charlie Kirk's death.  I maybe Gen Z 
myself, even i know I don't take serious unless I know in my gut is 
serious, what you guys think (no I'm not trying to offend other gen 
zers, this is just question based on what is happening on social media, I
 know is not all of you, i'm only talking about the people from that 
generation who doesnt behave right on the internet).
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[yuckmouthteeth]: Every gen has “snowflakes” in substantial supply.  Op is clearly 
pushing rage bait, everyone knows tons of insufferable people their own 
age.
[Safrel]: We really aren't.
[PrinceEntrapto]: Centuries ago you could be hung, drawn and quartered for insulting
 prominent figures, a hundred or so years ago it was socially acceptable
 to challenge somebody to a duel to the death over offence received, 
decades ago you could be jailed if your words or lifestyle didn’t jive 
with what the ruling classes or aristocracy didn’t like, as for internet
 misbehaviour it’s usually the white-haired and deeply-wrinkled types I 
see posting the most outright unhinged nonsense, long past the age where
 internet access should probably have been rescinded in the same vein 
those same people also have their driving licenses rescinded
So no, I wouldn’t say it’s particularly snowflake behaviour to be a
 bit of a twat online or not to give much of a shit when a public 
persona who once said gun death statistics are an acceptable tradeoff to
 retain the right to keep guns ends up becoming another gun death 
statistic, at least he died true to his principles
Exactly what i think. Just looking at 20th century America and the
 reaction for anything that was supposed to be progressive and the 
snowflakes from today stand no chance compared to the older generations.

[Thecustodian12]: Nah every generation has its cringe people, we’re just more open about it online so people see it more
[[deleted]]: I fucking hate this word.
What? Snowflake.
Yes.
I can respect that, plus even i wouldn't like that word, 
especially if I can become overly sensitive(and trust me i may have my 
own reasons), but at the same time sometimes overexaggeration can lead 
to problems around other people, and that's what I'm trying avoid.

It's not. You're fine.

[BackgroundTime8298]: I used to believe that but just learning basic history you gonna 
see how much of pussies the older generations were over really mundane 
stuff. The red scare, the opposition against civil rights, the rise of 
heavy metal and rap, there were all these obsessed Christian whining 
over it.
[Aubrey_D_Graham]: Older people called my generation snowflakes. I refuse to call Z, Alpha, and Betas as snowflakes.
[MiguelIstNeugierig]: Canceling who? Eminem?😭
Nah. If anything, older generations are the snowflakes whenever 
they get jumpscared at the world "pronouns" or seeing two men holding 
hands
[Mbiyxoaim]: I actually think most Gen-Z are too insensitive.
[Still_Cantaloupe2141]: I think Gen Z is actually pretty tough because of all the 
difficulties they face at almost every turn of trying to live a “normal”
 life in the sense of the “American Dream”. Sure, every generation has 
something problematic..but I don’t associate most of Gen Z with 
snowflakes.
[jimbojimmyjams_]: Bruh, I really don't. You gotta also keep in mind that the people 
who you see as sensitive and are more vocal about "cancelling" people or
 whatever are online. You'll see more of them because they create 
traction and get engagement. That's why social media pushes their posts,
 but most people are pretty reasonable and friendly irl.
Also, people getting upset by racism, sexism, and other forms of 
bigotry arent "snowflakes" btw. Being sensitive about those things is a 
good thing. It's annoying when the word "snowflake" is thrown around by 
people who often fit that label themselves.
I'm not saying they don't have the right to be upset when it comes
 racism, sexism, or bigotry, I would be too, if i face bigotry or I see 
bigotry. I'm just saying those people who see something or hear 
something, like adult jokes assume it is bigotry without looking at it 
more to see if it's hurtful or not, or if it big problem or not, and it 
also the way they reacting to it too and took action. I don't call them 
snowflakes because they upset bigotry, I(well not just me, most people) 
call them because it is the way they overexaggerate over something that 
is not even considered offensive. Again, im not saying, they don't have 
the right to be upset and they should have the right to not like the 
speech and signs, im saying they letting their overexaggeration becoming
 a problem around other people. That's what i meant by snowflakes.
I gotchu, but my point still stands. I still think it's mostly an 
online issue though when it comes to gen Z. Irl, people I've seen 
overreact to things in public are from older generations. I used to work
 in a grocery store and had no issues with young adults. I'd say the 
worst of it came from boomers and gen X. Millennials had a few 
instances, but not many. It is fair to say that I didn't have nearly as 
many gen Z customers as the other gens, but even outside of working in a
 grocery store, it's always the older gens that have the most of those 
overraction moments, whereas gen Z is typically super passive and will 
avoid arguments.

[Danthrax81]: As an elder millennial/xennial who has a few close Gen Z friends

But the last 40% are anywhere from flaky to soft and entitled to straight up problematic.
A lot of it depends on the parents and, not surprisingly, where they were born.
The ones who are my friends grew up in rural areas,  played 
outside when they were young, had parents that made them do chores and 
enforced a certain amount of discipline and are not obsessed with social

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk

change based on your opinion.
TLDR: Do boomers have a high rate of NPD? And if so, at least one of their genX children are likely to have it.
First. This post is intended for millennials and genZ. If you are 
older I respectfully request you leave/ allow room for younger people to
 answer.
Here is my theory. I genuinely believe that many (majority) of boomers likely have undiagnosed personality disorder.
There is nothing wrong with PD. That's no ones fault. However, 
boomers (broadly speaking) do not seek adequate therapy, work to 
understand it or talk about mental illness. This has impacted society 
hence backlash.
Now if they do have PD, en masse, specifically NPD (which tracks) 
then narc family dynamic will be almost a certainty. This means someone 
will be the golden child in the triangulation dynamic. The golden child 
is well known to replicate the NPD and become N's themselves.
Look up narcissistic or toxic family dynamics if you want to familiarise with sibling triagulation.
If many genX are parented by the Baby Boomer generation, then it 
makes sense a portion of them will be golden children. Almost all npd 
families have a golden child. Therefore the genX golden child will carry
 on the PD. And NPD is widely known to go untreated. The saddest part of
 that disease is it is rare a person with (true/clinical) NPD ever 
realises it.
Hey look its just an idea. Im not saying I'm right. I welcome intelligent discussion.
If you are an older person and you have the overwhelming urge to 
post some variation of "not all boomers" then please do not centre 
yourself here. This post is not about you, if you are able to make sense
 of that. Do try.
I genuinely want to know what younger gens think about my theory. Are boomers the NPD generation?
Again, PD is no ones fault and its ok to have mental health 
issues. No one should ever be ashamed. I'm not vilifying, I'm simply 
curious.

There's no one single word specifically. But just if you see a heated argument, the normal words that come up.
i can't speak for everyone but personally i will only use words 
that i am mostly sure of the meaning of. when i see a new word i can 
usually parse its meaning from the context of the sentence but sometimes
 i'll look it up.
this is not perfect, when i was younger i thought the word 
"approximate" was the same as "exact." I never looked up or asked about 
the definition of it and eventually i was corrected on it by my mom. so i
 suppose it's possible that some folks don't fully understand what the 
words they use really mean, but you can't say for sure with everyone i

That’s actually a great way to break down the many arguments over 
and accusations of privilege. Reminds me of a conversation that I, a 
white man, had with a friend, a black woman, several years ago. I 
concluded that, while I have never received any benefits or privileges 
simply for being white or for being a man, I would also never experience
 or understand the disadvantages she faced for being black or being a 
woman.
Maybe if we hadn’t turned “privilege” into such a loaded buzzword 
we’d be able to have more insightful conservations and understand each 
other better.

For as much as people post about mental health advocacy, their 
actions tell a very different story (I may be doing the same here.
To me the most prominent cultural ideas that make me believe this 
are the concepts of manipulator music and trauma dumping.
With manipulator music, in the case of both "male manipulator" and
 "female manipulator" music the artists are almost always mainstream and
 are almost always more emotionally open/vulnerable than average in 
their songs. Of course it's silly to think that someone's music tastes 
are a judge of character, but the existence of this label and what falls
 under it is a bit concerning.
I agree with being against traumadumping as it's defined: people 
throwing their burdens onto the unwilling; that's unfair to the 
recipient. The problem comes when people conflate traumadumping and any 
sort of emotional openness or admission of negative feelings. It makes 
it feel unsafe to confide in anyone but the closest.
I'm all for self respect, but it shouldn't take priority over the mental health of others.
Generationally we're growing up in and are feeding into a culture of narcissism, and it's fucking terrifying

Such a selfish term. Oh, are you feeling burdened by hearing about someone’s trauma? Cry me a river
“Trauma dumping” and “trauma bond”. People have woefully 
misinterpreted what “trauma bond” means. I remember seeing this guy talk
 about how the woman he was dating opened up to him about some stuff she
 went through since they went through similar trauma, and he cut her off
 because she was “trying to trauma bond” with him. That’s not what that 
means! Imagine opening up on some hard emotional shit to someone you 
think cares about you, and they cut you off cause of misinformed 
“therapy speak” on tik tok.
Yeah, the thing about trauma dumping is it's about appropriate: 
time, location, degree of closeness, detail given, and reciprocity.  It 
shouldn't be a blanket indictment against being emotionally open.
Time: Your friend may be a person you can open up to about your 
miscarriage... Doing so at their baby shower is not the appropriate time
 and you should find someone else
Location: You might want to talk to your friend about your 
difficult divorce...  At their kid's softball game might not be the 
appropriate place.  Wait until you guys are back home.
Degree of closeness: You might have a lot of feelings about the 
death of your son... the appropriate person to share that with is not 
someone waiting in line with you at the grocery store, call your friend.
Detail given: You might want to talk with your mom about how badly
 you were treated by your ex...  You might not want to share explicit 
details about your sex life with that person and save it for someone 
else who is prepared to hear it.
Reciprocity: Everyone has bad stretches where you need more 
support than others, but if you are constantly sharing all your problems
 with someone while not giving them space to lean on you as well, it's 
being an emotional leech instead of relying on a friend.
People have used a reasonable reminder to be mindful of your 
audience as a way to justify selfish and emotionally distant behavior.  
It is reasonable to expect to be able to rely on the people close to you
 for comfort when you're going through a rough time.  Your life 
shouldn't be sectioned into "emotionally sterile small talk" and 
"conversations with my therapist".
People just have some degree of responsibility to pay attention to
 their circumstances though, and if they don't, they might be considered
 rude (which doesn't mean you're a terrible person, everyone is rude 
sometimes).  I'm also sick of "toxic" supplanting "rude"...  Someone 
isn't a toxic person just because they aren't very socially aware.

[Sali-Zamme]: Gen Z are the new boomers, selfish and narcissistic. The same 
mentality of “tough it up” in boomers you can see it in Gen Z, but this 
time is dressed in a salad word bullshit of righteousness and fancy 
terms.
Feels like you need to find better peers. If the Gen Z you’re 
around are displaying the same lack of empathy that drives a culture of 
trivialization, then don’t hang around them. Could also make an attempt 
to educate as to why that behavior isn’t acceptable.
Drawing comparisons to possibly the most materialistic, 
self-absorbed, stagnant-brained generation in living memory is a tenuous
 argument at best, though - specifically when over half the generation 
in question (Gen Z) is still in their teens. They’re still learning, 
their brains are still developing. Lay off?
And I’d argue that’s how it should be with historical hindsight, 
that generation, despite what they may have created for future gen’s, 
was the most profitable and happiest generation we’ve seen in years. If 
we repeat that but with actual generational wealth rather then them 
hoarding it till death, half of gen beta would likely not need to work 
due to money from the gen Z parents.
Yes because Gen Z does need to tough it up. If you're complaining 
to me about something that could be worked on but somehow you manage to 
spend 3-4 hours a day gaming or watching TV, I'm not going to have 
sympathy for you. Just an example.

OP referred to "traumadumping" being misused to justify a hostile 
reaction to others' emotional expression. I might have communicated it 
poorly, but my intention was to point out that traumadumping is but one 
of many misused terms in our common language stemming from a pop 
psychology origin. Many other so-called "therapy speak" words are 
similarly stripped of context and meaning, then often used to morally

[[deleted]]: There’s a balance to be struck, I would think.
I know from personal experience how people may shy away from my 
over-expression of internal demons (in spite of how it has hurt me in 
the past).
But, I can understand why they were that way. And, I do have 
people in my life who listen, at the very least. Redditors who 
(sometimes) offer me some kind words, or good advice.
It’s very difficult, when you’re lonely, and feel that there’s no one who would care enough, for you to vent to them.
Maybe there are some people who like to be vented to (I am one of 
those people), while there are others who may find it overwhelming, or 
mood-killing, in a sense.
I can understand not wanting to be vented to by a relative 
stranger or acquaintance but if person A and person B are friends and 
person A doesn't want to hear out person B's issues or vice versa I 
wouldn't call their relationship a friendship

It's extremely harmful that the default assumption is that if a 
relationship ends badly that means there must have been one abuser and 
one abused and it's very important to pick the right side
There is no long term effect this can have other than discouraging anyone getting in any kind of relationship at all
If "you" is addressing me specifically, I have no problems with people venting to me no matter how "much" it gets.

The issue you present existed in my day without the internet.
It may just be western culture.
[[deleted]]: I'm a teacher, I agree with what you are saying. I haven't heard 
this music manipulator stuff before but I agree with the trauma dumping 
part. Compassion seems hard to come by. From moving a lot and changing 
schools a lot (including transferring schools in college) I can't seem 
to put my finger on what makes different communities more compassionate 
than others. I do wonder if some of us gen z's put on a facade of not 
needing compassion and therefore being apathetic towards others since 
that's how others have treated us at times. I would love input on this 
theory.
A lack of empathy is the result of a lack of empathy, yes.
But it can be corrected by finding places to practice empathy, 
even if we're starting as adults. There are many avenues to doing this. 
Self-help, therapy, volunteering, discussion groups, etc.
One could even Google 'how do I develop more empathy', or search Reddit for ideas.
Plenty of us were raised without that role modeling, but we can learn the skills we need at any time.

[Climbysrevenge]: I think I speak for a lot of people including myself when I say 
this, it's hard to be open with people like that. Especially when it's 
someone you care about. And it's not all social pressure a lot of it is 
just anxiety. I know personally that it can be terrifying to tell 
certain people about how you feel and your emotional state. It's hard 
not to let myself just shutdown entirely when it comes to even 
experiencing certain emotions. Oftentimes in moments when I should be 
experiencing some of the more extreme negative emotions, especially when
 it comes to sadness I just kinda go emotionally numb for a little 
while. I really don't think it's us perpetuating it, not intentionally 
at least, I think it's just hard for a lot of people to be emotionally 
vulnerable.
[TheHomesickAlien]: being cool has never been cooler. and it's fucking dumb.
[PViper439]: Whenever you continually have your emotions rejected by those 
around you, it makes sense you’d loose your emotional vulnerability. 
Fact of the matter is, the vast majority of people do not care about 
you, or whatever you are going through so it’s best to save your energy 
for people who actually care.
[Legal_Lettuce6233]: I know people that took their lives. I tried the same twice. I'm 
still a mess, and will be probably forever. If you have a problem with 
me breaking down once in 15 years, then we ain't friends.
[ZeroDSR]: What started the oppression olympics wasn’t music. But sure, most media output (be it music, tv…) perpetuated it.
The Olympic has no winners. Quite the opposite. Will the 
generation to follow revolt, or will they fade further into the 
diminishing population.
[[deleted]]: I mean if it's true, it wouldn't surprise me.
Gen Z, I would imagine, have observed the pure chaos of older 
siblings, or even parents, trying to seek help in a very public way 
(that's not an insult to those people, because that's what they were 
encouraged to do for years).
Z are probably first generation that can see the "let's talk about
 our mental health" for what it is; an utterly hollow experience 
packaged and sold by influencers.
[[deleted]]: Why would you confide in anyone other than your closet people 
anyway? In most situations offering up any more information about you or
 your life than is what is absolutely necessary can definitely be 
detrimental to you. Lots of people have ulterior motives.
[___--__---___--__---]: We know.
[IntimidatingBlackGuy]: I have to disagree with some of this post. Being open with friends
 and family is great, but we all have our limits. I’ve had friends spend
 over an hour ranting about something traumatic that happened in their 
past for over an hour, on a regular basis. And he called me selfish 
because I couldn’t spend more than 20 minutes hearing about his trauma 
without spiraling myself.
I have a therapist that I vent to every week because I don’t want 
be a source of negativity to my friends and family. People in your life 
should support you, but most people are not equipped to deal with mental
 health issues. And that’s okay. Expecting your friends to function like
 therapists or counselors is not okay.
[Spungus_abungus]: Most of GenZ are children.
We're not perpetuating much of any culture
Amongst our peers?
All of us still have developing minds. I would think that stuff like this is important to discuss.
The youth culture is a subset that typically ends up defining the 
culture as they come into adulthood. None of gen Z are literal children 
they’re now all teens or young adults no matter where you draw the line.
Gen Z starts in 1997, and ends in early 2010s. Means over half 
right now are legally adults. And you don't need to be an adult to 
perpetuate an opinion.
There will come a time when Gen Z will be the ones raising and 
teaching younger generations. What's happening now will show there, 
trust me.

[buildasky]: Can we have an example of what you think is manipulator music, like an artist/song?
From what I've seen people tend to associate the term with artists
 like Olivia Rodrigo, Deftones, Radiohead, Billie Eilish, Weezer, 
Neutral Milk Hotel that sorta thing
how is this type of music contributing to culture against 
vulnerability? And/or  how are people using this type of music 
negatively? Sorry not trying to be argumentative, just curious.
I think it's less so about the concept itself but moreso the wider
 implications. If music that discusses emotionally sensitive topics is 
considered to be enjoyed by manipulative people, a link gets created 
there between manipulative tendencies and emotional vulnerability
I know people who have felt stigmatized for the type of music they
 listen to, taking the manipulator music idea seriously and making them 
insecure about their own tastes

[LugiaLvlBtw]: I have an experience much to the opposite. A 2001 born friend of 
mine taught me, 33 at the time the phrase "Emotions are energy in 
motion." She did that because I suddenly broke in tears, due to missing 
my Mom. Although I cried pretty hard, she could still tell I was holding
 back. Next time I saw her, I told her it was because I didn't want 
passers by to think she had done something to me to cause me to cry. EX:
 He looks like a nice guy, why did you have to break his heart. To which
 she replied maybe people need to see a man going through something like
 that, to more normalize it.
[Gsomethepatient]: Therapy is just a scam, are there legitimate reasons for people to
 go to therapy, yes absolutely, like a parents divorce or someone dying,
But for hormonal teens or people "diagnosed" with some mental 
problem don't, like adhd, I was diagnosed with that specifically ADD, I 
only went to my "therapist", I put that in quotes because he got his 
medical license revoked because he got a dui while high on meth, to get 
the prescription I'd always forget to take refilled,
I didn't need to be medicated mainly because the drugs didn't have
 an affect on me, but also it didn't affect my life in anyway, and I'm 
still wondering if I got misdiagnosed
Therapy definitely isn’t a scam if you find a therapist well suited to help your issues
There’s nothing wrong with “hormonal teens” going to therapy esp 
because most mental illnesses start presenting in teen years if they 
can’t cope with their emotions I’m not sure how it’s a scam
Adult Adhd person here 👋,  one quick way to check if you have the
 neurology of Adhd is when you drink caffeine, it makes you sleepy 
instead of waking you up... its the opposite reaction to neurotypicals 
because the stimulant finals allows for your brain to relax and 
therefore sleep.  1 energy drink with 180 caffeine content will knock me
 out.  As for my father who also has adhd, 1 coffee and it puts him to 
sleep...  If you don't have that, it could mean you were misdiagnosed,  
ADD is when your brain has low dopamine and thats identical to symptoms 
of depression so it could be just that... ADHD/ADD is when out brain 
cannot regulate dopamine and hyperactivity is when the dopamine is high.
For me, it's not only caffeine that I have an opposite reaction 
to. The neurologist when I was in ICU  just said my brain was 
just  "different" but didn't go into more detail. If I had been 
more coherent at the time, I would have asked more questions. 🤣
DayQuil also makes me sleepy and NyQuil keeps me awake. It's
 with a lot of things that I don't have the standard reaction. It's 
frustrating because they often do not know how  medication will 
affect me in advance and we have to test it out in smaller than normal 
dosages because there is so little data on those who are prone to 
adverse reactions.
I have difficulty being put out for surgery as well and after a 
horrific experience of watching them cut me open when I was supposed to 
be knocked out, I always have to let the anesthesiologist know in 
advance so they don't use the regular stuff on me. 😅
Fellow adult ADHDer here. It's all ADHD, the H can just 
manifest differently, same as anything that is on a spectrum. I would 
also advise against such methods to self-test. It's honestly shocking 
how much misinformation is out there and even spread by people who have 
it and should know better. Another shocker is how easily some people get
 a diagnosis and how many people don't respond to meds (I wonder 
why...).
This isn't true.

They do work for everyone, just our brain responds differently.

--- DOCUMENTO: Gen Z men who struggle with dating_ Don't blame yourself _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: Gen Z men who struggle with dating: Don't blame yourself : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
In any discussion related to the situation of young men in dating,
 men are immediately met with "maybe it's your personality" or "do you 
even have any hobbies"?
This is at best misguided and at worst a deliberate lie.
Astudy foundthat women liked around 4.5% of male profiles on Tinder, whereas men 
liked 61.9% of female profiles. Do 95% of men have poor personalities 
and no hobbies?
Anotherstudyfound that while the average amount of sexual partners men had has 
remained static from 2002 to 2013, five percent of men saw their number 
of partners increase by 38% whereas the bottom 80% (or so) of men saw a 
decrease in sexual/romantic partners. Imagine how much worse it is 
post-Covid over a decade later.
"Personality" isn't the reason why.People who were childhood bullies were found to experience greater sexual/romantic success than the general population.
Another study found "nicer" men are less favored in dating.
Several studies have found men with "dark triad" (narcissism, 
Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) to be more sexually successful.Here's one, but this certainly isn't an outlier, the literature is very consistent on this.
Male
 hobbies and relationship intentions did not predict romantic success; 
in online dating, most decisions were made in less than one second.
The conclusion is to stop telling young men that the reason behind
 their lack of sexual/romantic success is because they are "boring" or a
 shitty person. It's not at all backed up by empirical evidence. This is
 the just-world fallacy; it's the same thing as saying the reason a poor
 person is poor is because of their moral character.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[number1GojoHater]: The problem with todays generation is that we are so self absorbed
 and anti social that we write people off so easily. Social media is the
 biggest proprietor of this. If you’re not a 10/10 then give up on 
tinder, you’re not going to want the women on their anyways. Go out with
 friends and try to socialize more, the more practice you get the more 
confidence you’ll gain as well
Don’t forget the lack of third spaces. I moved to my current city 2
 years ago. It’s so freaking hard to meet new people without spending 
money. Insanely hard if you’re new. It’s freaking frustrating
This is by far the biggest issue and reason for so many problems 
in Gen Z (the second one being the biological clocks going differently)
I disagree. It has nothing to do with a lack of third spaces. The 
truth is, a lot of young people don't go out, and we have become 
increasingly more introverted over time. Social media is the main cause 
for that to me
I think there is some truth but we also grew up not being welcomed
 in public. Personally as a kid some stores wouldn’t let you in without 
adults. We could go to the park, but as a teenager now I don’t know 
where I could go to chill without spending money
That’s always been mostly true. As a millennial, we went to malls,
 movies, bars, played sports, whatever… all of those things costed 
money. Either we paid for it or our parents did.
The difference is that when we wanted to socialize, Facebook, 
instagram, Snapchat, etc. were not our first social outlet. We USED 
social media to keep up with people and schedule real life hangouts. 
These days, people just skip that second part and stay online 
indefinitely. They don’t schedule meetups. They just chat online and 
never go out.
That doesn’t have to be the case. The problem is that social media
 has become the destination. It has become the goal. If you grew up 
without all that stuff, social media was just a tool you used to enhance
 your life in the real world. Then social media became 100x more 
addictive by design. Gluing your eyeballs to the screen became their 
overriding business goal, and GenZ became the main target once they 
figured out how to optimize that.
To be fair the mall didn't really cost money since most of the 
time we were just wandering around and socializing, not shopping.
/millennial
Yeah, and we don't go out because we can't fucking afford shit. 
You try paying for your own place at 12.50 an hour and tell me how we 
are supposed to be able to afford anything but going to work, maybe a 
little volunteering, and then going home to your cramped room to eat 
beans on toast, ramen, rice, broccoli and chicken(at least there is soy 
sauce and Tony Chacheres to spice things up), and then only have two 
meals of that because eating breakfast is a luxury you could only afford
 if you put a godforsaken amount of effort budgeting and micromanaging, 
hoping you can pay for the bills that keep getting more expensive, 
including paying for car insurance what used to be the price of monthly 
car payments.
Also, if you live in the U.S. forget it the cities are barely 
walkable, so you probably have to drive, which costs gas and maybe a 
little extra depending on maintenance and insurance policies.
Download Meetup, go to events. Tons of them are low/no cost.
Yeah Meetup is great, until you realize the only people going out 
to the single events are guys in the late 30’s and early 40’s. This was 
for a singles group that is in their 20’s. The single groups around my 
area are disappointing to say the least. Plus when I went to one and 
brought two friends who are girls, none of the guys could even talk to 
them… they literally just stared at them… it was very very awkward, 
needless to say never went out with that other group again.
I really don't get this. What third places existed before that 
don't exist now where you didn't have to spend any money?
Public houses and community centers. Other spaces like lounges, 
arcades, coffee shops and club houses use to be cheaper too, and much 
less corporate. A lot of community oriented places have gone by the way 
side, and the ones that are still around are either being made into 
corporate establishments, or are being choked out for advertising due to
 the globalization of news and advertisements, as well as their cost.
Its not just tinder though. Even in real life If you are a man and
 you aren’t 10/10, ripped, rich, and tall you are invisible. And most 
men just dont have that at age 18. It’s unrealistic.

would still be an absurd filter to set. Like most people aren’t super 
tall so I don’t understand why women think they should all be able to 
date 6’0” and taller guys
I’m 5’11 and a half and it’s insane to think I’d be cut off by all those women from the jump.
I'm 5'5". I'd be considered as an option byless than 10% of women.That would really help explain the fact that I've been single my entire
 life, if I wasn't already aware and socially useless. I'm just shocked 
to know how low value I really am from a statistical standpoint.

I literally watched a guy get rejected on a dating show for being 
5’11 and not 6’0. They pulled out a measuring tape. You can lie but once
 that measuring tape comes out it’s over 💀
This is a very specific group, a group that views dating like 
shopping. I would really not put that much stock in this graph by 
extrapolating those results to the general population.
Crazy almost as if this is online dating and not real life where I have multiple friends that are below 5’9 that have gfs
Replying to statistics with anecdotal evidence, very cool
I wouldn’t say that’s true in real life. When you’re really 
outside, it is a million times easier to win people over with your 
personality rather than your looks. I would say the real problem is more
 that a lot of people have stopped trusting strangers that approach them
 because we’re not used to it as much, and most people only look for 
dates online now, which exacerbates the problem.
I’d say this is more the problem. People are just relying on 
online dating and apps more than meeting people in person, so the 
screwed up rules and standards that go along with a much much larger 
dating pool are more in focus. Honestly the biggest issue with it imo is
 it gives way to many people an illusion of choice. Back in our parents 
days before the internet you were pretty much limited to the people 
around you in any given moment. With the internet and apps you got 
pretty much everyone as a match. So way too many people refuse to settle
 cause the perfect match could be out there still. While back in the day
 if you weren’t someone connected to those types of people they weren’t 
even in your dating pool.
But honestly dating and meeting people in person is no different 
than it was back in the day as it still limits it to people actually 
around you. Imo.
No this is where yall have got to stop doomering. If you are in a 
position where you have single male friends and can go out regularly, 
just talk to some girls. You might be surprised at how easy it can be 
with some practice. Girls have 1/10th the standards in real life 
compared to the apps.
If you lack third spaces and friends, you’re fucked. Or more accurately not fucked.
Trust me I’ve tried. Ive done my due diligence in hygiene, im not 
overweight, im kind. 10 seconds in I realize that the conversation is 
one way and their body language suggests that they ain’t interested so i
 end it before she tells everyone im a weirdo
[[deleted]]: Don’t forget the lack of third spaces. I moved to my current city 2
 years ago. It’s so freaking hard to meet new people without spending 
money. Insanely hard if you’re new. It’s freaking frustrating
This is by far the biggest issue and reason for so many problems 
in Gen Z (the second one being the biological clocks going differently)
I disagree. It has nothing to do with a lack of third spaces. The 
truth is, a lot of young people don't go out, and we have become 
increasingly more introverted over time. Social media is the main cause 
for that to me
I think there is some truth but we also grew up not being welcomed
 in public. Personally as a kid some stores wouldn’t let you in without 
adults. We could go to the park, but as a teenager now I don’t know 
where I could go to chill without spending money
That’s always been mostly true. As a millennial, we went to malls,
 movies, bars, played sports, whatever… all of those things costed 
money. Either we paid for it or our parents did.
The difference is that when we wanted to socialize, Facebook, 
instagram, Snapchat, etc. were not our first social outlet. We USED 
social media to keep up with people and schedule real life hangouts. 
These days, people just skip that second part and stay online 
indefinitely. They don’t schedule meetups. They just chat online and 
never go out.
That doesn’t have to be the case. The problem is that social media
 has become the destination. It has become the goal. If you grew up 
without all that stuff, social media was just a tool you used to enhance
 your life in the real world. Then social media became 100x more 
addictive by design. Gluing your eyeballs to the screen became their 
overriding business goal, and GenZ became the main target once they 
figured out how to optimize that.
To be fair the mall didn't really cost money since most of the 
time we were just wandering around and socializing, not shopping.
/millennial
Yeah, and we don't go out because we can't fucking afford shit. 
You try paying for your own place at 12.50 an hour and tell me how we 
are supposed to be able to afford anything but going to work, maybe a 
little volunteering, and then going home to your cramped room to eat 
beans on toast, ramen, rice, broccoli and chicken(at least there is soy 
sauce and Tony Chacheres to spice things up), and then only have two 
meals of that because eating breakfast is a luxury you could only afford
 if you put a godforsaken amount of effort budgeting and micromanaging, 
hoping you can pay for the bills that keep getting more expensive, 
including paying for car insurance what used to be the price of monthly 
car payments.
Also, if you live in the U.S. forget it the cities are barely 
walkable, so you probably have to drive, which costs gas and maybe a 
little extra depending on maintenance and insurance policies.
Download Meetup, go to events. Tons of them are low/no cost.
Yeah Meetup is great, until you realize the only people going out 
to the single events are guys in the late 30’s and early 40’s. This was 
for a singles group that is in their 20’s. The single groups around my 
area are disappointing to say the least. Plus when I went to one and 
brought two friends who are girls, none of the guys could even talk to 
them… they literally just stared at them… it was very very awkward, 
needless to say never went out with that other group again.
I really don't get this. What third places existed before that 
don't exist now where you didn't have to spend any money?
Public houses and community centers. Other spaces like lounges, 
arcades, coffee shops and club houses use to be cheaper too, and much 
less corporate. A lot of community oriented places have gone by the way 
side, and the ones that are still around are either being made into 
corporate establishments, or are being choked out for advertising due to
 the globalization of news and advertisements, as well as their cost.

[[deleted]]: Have you thought about ditching dating apps and meeting people 
organically? Online dating seems to be a big part of the problem.
People are still kind of flaky and antisocial in real life. It feels like a generational/age problem.
Meeting people irl is still less likely to result in flakey results
It's still a very high flaky
I think folks our age are flaky in general regardless of how 
you’ve met them. They are so commitment-phobic and seem absolutely 
terrified of taking any kind of risks. It’s rough. I mean I’m female and
 I’ve put myself out there a number of times with only poor results. But
 I still sorta try because there’s no real use in giving up. But I feel 
like I see a lot of others simply giving up really quickly or they don’t
 seem willing to move out of their comfort zones at all. This is similar
 even in my friendships. A lot of emotional fragility that is taxing to 
navigate.
I’ve had more people flake on dates than I can count. I dont know 
what it is, getting the number is the easy part but getting someone, 
ANYONE to commit to one simple date might as well be trigonometry. I’m 
not talking just women (as a guy), I’ve had friends flake and not even 
hit me up to say “hey sorry, I can’t make it let’s reschedule for X 
day”. It’s not a generational thing because I’ve gotten this from people
 older than me too, it’s a “today” issue. I dont know if it’s FOMO or 
someone got a better offer but it’s mind numbingly stupid.
People have always been flaky, especially when they’re in their 20s. This isn’t new.
What will get you dates is being outgoing and social. The cited 
studies bury the lede, bullies have no issue talking to people, online 
dating absolutely requires a good strategy including attractive pictures
 (what the fuck is “top X %”? It means nothing but makes you think it’s 
about attractive vs ugly when in reality it’s good pictures and good 
texting skills, something you can fix). Improving your personality and 
having interesting things to do and talk about like hobbies and such 
does help, especially for breaking the ice with conversations and with 
finding someone longer term, but it doesn’t matter how charismatic and 
interesting you are if you don’t ever talk to anyone. And to avoid being
 seen as a creep, talk to lots of people, make lots of friends and 
acquaintances, don’t just walk up to attractive women and try to ask 
them out. If you’re talking to everyone, you’re talking to people you’re
 attracted to too, and they won’t get the ick from you.
Couples formed through dating apps and Instagram are increasingly 
common. And even if you meet someone in real life, that person's 
expectations about the ideal man are idealized by social media anyway.
it's better IRL but only marginally. I think for those older than 
Gen Z this advice is more effective but Gen Z itself doesn't go to bars

Women also go outside far, far less than men. My own anecdotal 
findings working a job where I meet randos quite often has shown me that
 most women at public events are either there with a partner or are 
already taken, regardless of their age. Most single women go out far 
less than single men.

[Careful_Response4694]: People are still kind of flaky and antisocial in real life. It feels like a generational/age problem.
Meeting people irl is still less likely to result in flakey results
It's still a very high flaky
I think folks our age are flaky in general regardless of how 
you’ve met them. They are so commitment-phobic and seem absolutely 
terrified of taking any kind of risks. It’s rough. I mean I’m female and
 I’ve put myself out there a number of times with only poor results. But
 I still sorta try because there’s no real use in giving up. But I feel 
like I see a lot of others simply giving up really quickly or they don’t
 seem willing to move out of their comfort zones at all. This is similar
 even in my friendships. A lot of emotional fragility that is taxing to 
navigate.
I’ve had more people flake on dates than I can count. I dont know 
what it is, getting the number is the easy part but getting someone, 
ANYONE to commit to one simple date might as well be trigonometry. I’m 
not talking just women (as a guy), I’ve had friends flake and not even 
hit me up to say “hey sorry, I can’t make it let’s reschedule for X 
day”. It’s not a generational thing because I’ve gotten this from people
 older than me too, it’s a “today” issue. I dont know if it’s FOMO or 
someone got a better offer but it’s mind numbingly stupid.
People have always been flaky, especially when they’re in their 20s. This isn’t new.
What will get you dates is being outgoing and social. The cited 
studies bury the lede, bullies have no issue talking to people, online 
dating absolutely requires a good strategy including attractive pictures
 (what the fuck is “top X %”? It means nothing but makes you think it’s 
about attractive vs ugly when in reality it’s good pictures and good 
texting skills, something you can fix). Improving your personality and 
having interesting things to do and talk about like hobbies and such 
does help, especially for breaking the ice with conversations and with 
finding someone longer term, but it doesn’t matter how charismatic and 
interesting you are if you don’t ever talk to anyone. And to avoid being
 seen as a creep, talk to lots of people, make lots of friends and 
acquaintances, don’t just walk up to attractive women and try to ask 
them out. If you’re talking to everyone, you’re talking to people you’re
 attracted to too, and they won’t get the ick from you.

[Upset-Maintenance-25]: Couples formed through dating apps and Instagram are increasingly

expectations about the ideal man are idealized by social media anyway.

[imthewronggeneration]: I've simply stopped caring about dating altogether. It's not for me.
Yeah im sure some people just need to be in a relationship and 
will do whatever it takes to get one but for me its just not worth the 
effort. I don't know why anyone would waste all their time and energy to
 attract girls who aren't even half as interested as they are. There 
many other things you can do to keep yourself happy.
Imo, it's an ego boost. Yay! Someone's into me. I feel so in 
love...blah...blah...blah. 🙄  love really is just chemical reactions in
 your brain anyway.
🤦🏾
What’s crazy is I used to actually go out to bars to meet people 
and my “most successful” nights were when I stopped caring and went out 
without the actual intention of meeting someone
Same bro. I've put it on an indefinite hiatus while I focus on 
other stuff, little energy left for dating. After everything I've seen, 
toxic family dynamics, a few relationships of my own, I don't know if I 
really want to get married, have kids, etc.
I can understand this. Honestly I fucking hate dating. My last 
relationship happened because the other person and I just grew closer 
after several months. Dating is stressful, superficial, irritating and 
exhausting. Honestly I hate it and would prefer just to skip it all 
together.

[[deleted]]: I'm going to be honest here. I have never had a girlfriend. I 
don't know of any girls that would consider dating me atm, but I can't 
stand seeing this kind of stuff repeatedly posted here. There are girls 
and guys who are superficial and shitty and who only look for likeminded
 people with the superficial traits they admire. Of course, not everyone
 who prefers attractive people over unattractive people is superficial 
or shitty. That is just the way people are.
Being nice isn't a problem. Being a pushover, clingy, needy, and 
overbearing are. That is the real problem I suspect a lot of "nice guys"
 are having. Women are attracted to guys who are confident, assertive, 
and who can handle their emotions without needing constant 
reinforcement. Having the former set of traits doesn't make you a bad 
person, but it does mean it is your responsibility to work on them if 
you want to be a better partner. If you want a good partner without 
doing any of the work, you are immature.
Although I have never had a gf, I do have a lot of friends who are
 part of the opposite sex and they all are good friends with me because I
 treat them with respect. I will be honest, I do feel pretty sad 
sometimes about not having a girlfriend, but I also know that I need to 
be a better person before who is more resilient before I start putting 
myself out there. I want to be a good partner who makes someone else's 
life better.
If I were to blame society or whatever for my personal 
shortcomings, I would never see any growth nor would I ever have any 
hope of building a fulfilling relationship. I think there is at least 
hope for me if I don't become a bitter and angry person.
Problem is, if you improve yourself you still wanna find someone 
else who improved yourself. Otherwise you get resentful of 'dating 
down'.
Okay, there’s a balance tho. Not everything is your fault and not 
everything is society’s fault. Some of it just is what it is. It seems 
like you are steering towards the side where you are trying to take 
everything that has ever happened to you as your responsibility and that
 side drives you crazy, I’ve been there done that. You accurately 
described the follies of the other side so I don’t need to tell you why 
it’s a problem to blame everything on society but you should recognize 
that many of the problems you do have are at least partly because of 
society and culture and that you have a miniscule impact if any. That 
will make it easier to accept the things you can’t control.
I'm a bit autistic and have no talents whatsoever so I have no idea how to be "the confident man".
Then, yeah, you're probably not in a spot to be dating rn. Being 
confident is just being comfortable with yourself and secure in who you 
are and why you do the things you do - if you don't have that it's fine 
but you'd be better served by taking some time to figure out who you are
 and what you want for yourself.
I hate that this advice only ever comes up in a dating context 
because you should be doing that because everyone deserves comfort with 
the only person they'll be with 24/7, so do it for yourself; but that 
comfort with yourself is also a great sign that you live life 
deliberately and have a decent amount of discipline which are what a lot
 of people are looking for in a partner, so it helps immensely with 
dating too.
This doesn't mean you're bad or unattractive or unworthy of love, 
it means you still have a ways to go on your own path and you deserve to
 be able to focus on that path before finding a path with someone 
else.

Men are taught garbage, garbage that used to work in old society 
when men exploited the power dynamic EVEN MORE. It’s not that “you” a 
man, sucks, it’s stuff society put on you.
Women don’t like your tinder profile because you’re putting what 
you think a woman likes, but not what women actually want. And btw, 
women are just looking for a person. Not some stud, not some checkbook. A
 person.

it feels like you took every word I wanted to say out of my head

once people begin to realize how dating apps intentionally try to 
destroy your self-worth and self-esteem in order to keep you in (in 
hopes you’ll see more ads from them and possibly cave in to buy their 
premium memberships) it honestly makes a ton of sense.

You're shadow boxxing people who don't exist in a meanignful 
capacity. The people who get called misogynyistic are the ones who put 
the blame on women and create caricatures of women being vapid  and 
shallow.
What are you talking about? There are people calling this guy pathetic in this thread.
This straw man is more man than straw.
I get this reaction all the time on reddit lmao. And they wonder why young men are so resentful.
Most of these studies don't quite say what op claims, instead he's
 highlighting specific facts to construct a narrative not necessarily in
 line with the actual results.  For instance, people who fall into "dark
 triad" traits are typically just coming off confident, self assured, 
and not needy.  They're not walking up to women and declaring they're 
narcissists who are manipulating these women.  But confidence and self 
assurance are just attractive things.
The stat on "likes" comes specifically from super likes which only
 make up 1.4% of the sample. They also highlight reasoning and the 
feedback loop of men being less selective driving up more selectivity in
 women (which OP neglects to discuss) and vice versa and on and on.
Much of it also comes from online dating which are inherently self
 selecting as well, given that most people still meet their partners in 
the real world.
At face value, it seems compelling, but it's really not.
Well I mean the OP did claim feminists and subreddits like Two x  
should be banned because of a school shooter who is a...neo nazi. and 
not a radical feminist like he claims.

[hwf0712]: You cite a lot of studies, but you fail to address how many of them are relevant or easy criticism.
Your first is about Tinder, which has far too many uses to be 
relevant. A sample that includes people seeking one night stands, FWB, 
flings, and dating is going to be too polluted to use for just dating. 
Let alone one where there's many men swiping/liking/whatevering every 
woman they see trying to get their dick wet, and women then needing to 
do the filtering. But also, your question is silly, because I'd reckon 
that if you're looking through such a large sample size, since that many
 men do 'like' so many profiles, 95% of them will, in fact, not be 
compatible, especially since you can be so picky since you have so many 
men to choose.
Your second study is, again, irrelevant to dating.
Your third study is interesting, but hard to extrapolate anything 
from considering this is a lifetime thing, and it has somewhat of a self
 fulfilling prophecy involved. It makes sense that a kid who was 
bullied, who was ostracized in school is going to have worse success 
than one who didn't. It also further makes sense that in a time period 
where people's ability to recognize having done harm to others, and what
 is/isn't good behaviour, that those with the immediate perception that 
they're cool/good/whatever, such as by bullying, is going to have better
 success. If you can find something that talks mainly about young 
adulthood and onwards, such as when people leave their comfortable 
confines, and need to reinvent their social circle at college or work, 
then let's talk. But until then, I wouldn't take a study that includes 
people sitting in their bubbles with a lack of maturity in HS as 
something that works over a lifetime.
Your fourth study is flawed because it, for starters, isn't 
actually talking about niceness, its talking about something that can be
 seen as meaning being nice, but may not to others. The article talks 
about it, read the god dang article.
Your fifth, again, is not about dating. And its literally saying 
that people who are more prone to being manipulative are more able to 
get laid. Of course, when you're less concerned with the other person's 
feeling you might just wear them down...
Your sixth, again, is just about swiping on tinder. No where does 
it mention that the participants were instructed to do anything 
specific, other than 'start a conversation'. Of course, when you put 
people on a simulated hookup website, some people are just gonna look at
 attractiveness.
Just because you put hyperlinks, doesn't mean they actually mean anything. Go be an incel somewhere else.

Young men don't need to research about how no one wants to date 
them. That seems self evident by the lack of matches on their dating 
app.  What they want to know is why.
Dating apps are bad at giving feedback for why you aren't getting matches.

i’m finding this is my problem. a lot of men just don’t present 
themselves in a way that is appealing at all. and nearly all of the ones
 ive matched with are terrible with a conversation. if you message me 
first, don’t force me to have a one sided conversation and give me short
 one word answers

y’all really expect things to change? The current dating scene is human 
nature and sexual selection completely exposed for all of us to see. We 
can point out statistics about this stuff but at the end of the day 
human nature will not change.
[Clean-Cow-9549]: Good post, the world isn't just, you can't change that, but you can't just give up either.
I think giving up on relationships would actually make alot of people much happier.

Yeah people tend to be a bit delusional about love to the point of
 straight up denying science. Evolution would never occur if there 
weren't a certain subset of the species procreating exclusively. The 
reality is that we can't choose to be loved any more than we chose to be
 born. We're all subject to nature and its inequalities. The only person
 you can be mad at for that is god.
Some people are just not meant to reproduce. The current lineage 
leading to you had only 30% of men successfully reproduce. Lotta guys 
died in wars or through diseases.
You can’t just give up either
Actually, turns out you can 😁👍
[Foreign-Ad-9527]: I think giving up on relationships would actually make alot of people much happier.

Yeah people tend to be a bit delusional about love to the point of
 straight up denying science. Evolution would never occur if there 
weren't a certain subset of the species procreating exclusively. The 
reality is that we can't choose to be loved any more than we chose to be
 born. We're all subject to nature and its inequalities. The only person
 you can be mad at for that is god.

[lillilllillil]: Some people are just not meant to reproduce. The current lineage 
leading to you had only 30% of men successfully reproduce. Lotta guys 
died in wars or through diseases.

[Varsity_Reviews]: Meh. It’s whatever anyway. I’m not a good looking guy, and I’m not
 particularly good at anything, so I was already out of the dating pool 
anyway.
[[deleted]]: Anyway, does anybody want anything from 7 eleven? I'm making a quick stop on the way home
[Cheyenne888]: I feel like meeting people irl is a better idea
Couples formed through dating apps and Instagram are increasingly 
common. And even if you meet someone in real life, that person's 
expectations about the ideal man are idealized by social media anyway.

[micrill]: Im just gonna continue to do me, not giving up
[Future_Recipe4994]: Everyday in this sub is about this stupid ass topic. how about you
 go outside and do something more productive?? I promise there’s so much
 more to life than just dating.
[Common5enseExtremist]: I noticed I had more success when I didn’t care nearly as much and
 put more effort into doing things that are fun for myself rather than 
“dates”. But this was over a year ago, I’ve since turned to the Church 
and been (mostly) celibate and happier for it.
lol yeah joining a cult and being celibate isn’t the answer bud
[MrCrunchwrap]: lol yeah joining a cult and being celibate isn’t the answer bud
[lillilllillil]: There is a reason the far right is growing as a political arm in the world. Men want an easy solution.

TÍTULO: Gen Z misuses therapy speak too much : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I’ve noticed Gen Z misuses therapy speak way too much. Words like 
gaslight, narcissist, codependency, bipolar disorder, even “boundaries” 
and “trauma” are used in a way that’s so far from their actual 
psychiatric/psychological definitions that it’s laughable and I 
genuinely can’t take a conversation seriously anymore if someone just 
casually drops these in like it’s nothing.
There’s some genuine adverse effects to therapy speak like 
diluting the significance of words and causing miscommunication. 
Psychologists have even theorized that people who frequently use 
colloquial therapy speak are pushing responsibility off themselves -  
(mis)using clinical terms to justify negative behavior (ex: ghosting a 
friend and saying “sorry it’s due to my attachment style” rather than 
trying to change.)
I understand other generations do this too, but I think Gen Z really turns the dial up to 11 with it.
So stop it!! Please!! For the love of god. A lot of y’all don’t know what these words mean!
Here are some articles discussing the rise of therapy speak within GEN Z and MILENNIAL circles:

[_weIcwedhoe]: Roblox during a college class? Wow
It was very strange. This was also a beginners management class 
so… not sure what that kid is gonna manage if he can’t manage to stop 
playing roblox
Seems about right for a majority of middl managers I've dealt with.
MBA material right there...
Yeah, middle management here, I'm more of a Civ 6 guy but if you've ever seen Office Space it's very accurate.
Thats how it goes typically. They promote people who cant actually
 do the job so management. Why would a company promote someone who is 
good at their job?
Its doesnt actually make sense but it is certainly the mindset of 
those in the upper echelons of management and i see it play out all the 
time
Even in companies where good workers get promoted, this still 
ultimately leads to having bad managers. Workers and managers who excel 
will get promoted until they reach a position where they struggle to 
perform, and stagnate there. The consequence is a company full of people
 stuck in positions they can't do well in.
Peter principle
When high performers don’t get promoted it’s usually because they 
suck at interpersonal relationships with their coworkers or never asked 
for the promotion. I see too many people that are asocial or anti work, 
yet they expect to just get promoted after being cold to their 
colleagues for years.
I played video games in lectures I wasn't too keen on all the 
time, ngl, but I would never have had the audacity to get defensive over
 it. If a teacher ever called me on it I'd have just owned up to it.
Yeah same I would play games or read other things all the time, 
especially in big lectures for classes I didn't care about.  I tried to 
be discreet tho or I would just own up if called out.  It definitely has
 to do with how my brain works sure.
I’ve seen people on multiple occasions watchingpornon their laptops. Not just normal porn either, but weirdo furry stuff
Does that qualify as sexual harassment towards the class?
I can’t speak for school environments, but in a work environment it absolutely qualifies.
I remember playing doom during law school, it's not uncommon

[[deleted]]: Millennials did not. In my memory it started with Gen X American 
celebrities. Rich people who could afford therapy in the 90s & early
 00s - a time when therapy was still seen as something only for the 
seriously troubled. I’m an old-ish millennial (37) and I remember 
rolling my eyes at American celebrities going on Oprah to cry about 
their boundaries being overstepped and needing to work on “self care” 
etc. I shouldn’t have rolled my eyes, now the truth of celebrity life in
 the 90s is coming out - honestly it sounds like hell. But it certainly 
wasn’t my generation who normalised therapy speak, at least as far as I 
remember.
You know you’re absolutely right. I’m 30 and I remember the big 
push for therapy started with as you said talk show. I remember having a
 book of Letterman’s top 10 list that had some dry takes about therapy 
and psychs. Wasn’t there a whole cartoon about it, actually?? Nostalgia 
brick, thanks for reminding me . I think it was Dr. Katz
I’m 32. The only big mental health word I remember in middle 
school and high school was ADHD. EVERYTHING was blamed on ADHD. Anxiety 
wasn’t a thing. Depression was a joke that was a teenage affliction 
thanks to the emo scene.
I’m British so to us, it was all just “American” & we only got
 the biggest, most popular US talk shows on TV, but that is absolutely 
where it came from, in my perspective (to MUCH resistance from the Brits
 lol we wanted to stay miserable thanks)
Wrong. 42 here…and I’m tired of labeling generations. So now I’ll 
label Gen Z- they started it and are rolling with it. Therapy was very 
taboo for my people growing up. Nobody talked about it. Covid and #metoo
 really got this ball rolling. Gen Z is clinging onto these two like 
theyre breastfeeding from their mommy. It’s not all Gen Z but when they 
use this language I consider them a total joke.
I'm 43 and can confirm this.
Therapy in the 90s and early 2000s was awful especially for not 
yet diagnosed neurodivergent kids. Nothing like being told you have a 
personality disorder at the age of 15 and being drugged and thrown into 
an isolation room when you express terror at returning to an emotionally
 abusive home and school.

[Narcoid]: It's what unfortunately happens when technical terms become too 
mainstream. It's really bad with the field of psychology as a whole. I 
can't tell you how many times I've seen people use the term "cognitive 
dissonance" the wrong way. Hell, I've been downvoted for correcting 
people on the use of the term and I have two degrees in psychology.
Feeling anxious =/= having an anxiety disorder. Feeling sad or 
depressed =/= having major depressive disorder. Having mood swings =/= 
bipolar disorder. No your ex is not a narcissist. There's just a selfish
 dick.
It's a shame, but I've been seeing these terms get absolutely 
trashed because the public uses them so poorly so frequently. Psychology
 in particular has a unique problem behavior everyone experiences it, 
therefore everyone feels like they're an "expert" in it. And it all goes
 downhill from there.
Sciences will always struggle with remaining technically 
significant and not alienating themselves from the general population. 
Psychology just has a unique issue that things like physics, and 
mathematics don't have. It's incredibly frustrating.
Also lying and manipulating does not equal gaslighting. 
Gaslighting is a very specific and intense form of those things, yes. 
But if someone is lying to you they’re not gaslighting. If someone is 
they’d be more like
“Why did you turn the light off?”
“I didnt do that what do you mean?”
And continue to do so frequently enough where the person thinks 
their version of reality is crazy and they’re slowly going insane. It’s 
like advanced lying and manipulation in a cumulative aspect.
The best way I found to correct people is that lying and 
manipulation are a part of it. But gaslighting is convincing someone to 
believe a false reality. It's a pattern of behavior.
My ex was amazing at gaslighting. To the point I was seeing a 
doctor because I thought I had dementia. Daily I was being told I had 
forgotten conversations or places, I'd be told I'd met people before 
that IknewI never had and she would be so insistent that I 
would believe her because the then undiagnosed ADHD did make me 
forgetful. 4 years since I left and I still struggle with trusting my 
memory.
People really like to big up their problems, almost in a way that 
comes off as attempting to garner sympathy which they can use to excuse 
their shortcomings. I’ve seen people claim an argument with their family
 is trauma. Now I try not to be dismissive, but really too many people 
use these things as shields for criticisms that they can’t address. 
Can’t handle the college course? Just say the environment is causing 
anxiety. And too often, it’s validated because of course in person no 
one will question it

[[deleted]]: “Millennials started this trend”. What college did you go to as a 
millennial?  Because I can assure you this shit didn’t happen at 
Berkeley when I graduated as a millennial…. People were polite for the 
most part, and while there were always students playing games or 
watching videos or not paying attention in class, when called out on it 
they never talked back. I experienced that in high school…
Maybe you are conflating the terms “naive, immature, or 
privileged” with gen z or millennial. Saying “generation blank” does 
x,y, or z, takes away from the reality that humans behave similarly 
regardless of age. Emotional stability and immaturity can be called out 
without shitting on generation, gender, age, or race, but it seems this 
is a dying notion these days as everyone wants to play identity 
politics.
Millennial here too. We had the courtesy to just skip class entirely.
[Username89054]: Millennial here too. We had the courtesy to just skip class entirely.
[Lower-Career-6576]: Man it sounds like a bunch of entitled brats hiding behind the 
thin veil of mental illness, the world will not be kind to them
[CozyGamingGal]: I kinda agree in the sense generalizations and self diagnosis is 
problematic. However we do need to be careful about completely 
dismissing these claims as that too is harmful. We need to steer these 
people in the right direction by saying maybe you do please go to a Dr 
as it seems it’s possible but not guaranteed. Some of us actually do 
have issues and you can’t tell the difference between someone who is 
diagnosed or self diagnosed.
A lot of people scream anxiety for example and then never go to a doctor or therapist.
I do think OP is right, the self-diagnose without professionels are out of control.
Therapy isn’t cheap
I agree.
But just because a car is expensive, doesnt mean you should build your own.
Gotta fund public transit then
I agree 100%.
I am however from a socialist country, so funding public transit 
or free medical care is the better option compared to the alternative.
Vote for socialism in Gen Z.
"socialist country" as in "country where the workers own the means
 of production," or as in "social democracy?" if it's the formerpleasepost which one lol, because i'd LOVE to bring it up whenever someone 
tells me socialism doesn't work, vuvuzela iphone, etc. etc.
Denmark - so very much social democracy / free market economy with
 strong welfare programs (I’m a fan). But it’s certainly not “socialist”
 and it certainly has its own problems.
You can't self-diagnose just because therapy costs money.
Until a person has a professional diagnosis, then their complaints are just complaints.
I hear what you’re saying but I feel like a huge part of the 
problem is that everyone is telling each other to go to therapy.
We need actual genuine friendship. Real human connection that 
isn’t paid for. Therapy is only ONE PART of a persons support system, 
friends and family make up the rest of it.
We need to start being better friends to each other and stop 
dismissing everyone to a therapist the moment they start talking about 
their feelings. It’s incredibly painful and tells that person, “I don’t 
care”
And no, your of 5 years friend isn’t trauma dumping on you, they are opening up and being vulnerable with youwhich is something that therapy is teaching them to do to make stronger connections with others
That and therapy isn’t always the solution, my adhd causes my 
anxiety, therapy won’t fix either of those things only medication will. 
But even just generalized anxiety still can’t necessarily be fixed with 
therapy
I one hundred percent agree.
Therapy can’t fix grief either. Your grieving friend can’t think their way out of this with a therapist.
At this point in my life I realized that it’s actually not good 
for my mental health to pay someone to pretend to care about me. It’s 
incredibly triggering and painful to know that this person has no real 
interest in me as a person aside from the paycheck I’m offering them. I 
mean, are you my mom? Cause that’s literally how my relationship with 
her was. So no. I tried it, I tried it multiple times, with numerous 
therapist, and it just doesn’t help me.
Thankfully we live in a world of resources and I can actually just
 read the source books that the therapists read. And do yoga, and 
journal. But what I really need is friends and people who really care 
about me, and therapy doesn’t seem to be helpinganyof us with that.
I don’t really understand what people think “healed” is. To me 
being healed involves having a community of people around you that 
supports and loves each other. But it seems like the general public 
thinks being healed means never asking for support or sharing their 
sadness with anyone other than a therapist. It’s honestly so depressing.
As someone who actually was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and
 PTSD from some very serious events. The vast and I mean vast majority 
of people I have meet are self diagnosed and using it as an excuse. 
People have turned it into some sense of identity. It’s a victim 
mentality, because the people I have meet who have actually been through
 some shit will never tell you about it or even try and use it as an 
excuse.
Sure, some people struggle with generalized anxiety more than 
others. But, generalized anxiety cant be allowed to be weaponized for 
sloth. This is especially a problem with anyone still in school. Give 
them a single way to manipulate the system and they will. Especially, 
when you create a system that is impossible to call someone a liar 
within.
I don’t say this to denigrate Gen Z and Gen Alpha at all because 
it’s the fault of older generations, but we have given the younger 
generations this idea that you can be your authentic self in literally 
every situation and that society should adapt around you. That’s 
unfortunately not true, which we’re seeing in the workplace and in other
 spaces when Gen Z refuses to adapt to the norms. Gen Z brings some new 
refreshing perspectives, but we gotta meet in the middle somewhere.
The younger generations also haven’t built resiliency in the same 
way others have because we’ve catered to you. Hence the therapy 
speak/everything is traumatic issue when younger generations get out in 
the “real world.”

 strong welfare programs (I’m a fan). But it’s certainly not “socialist”
 and it certainly has its own problems.
[lucyfleur_]: "socialist country" as in "country where the workers own the means
 of production," or as in "social democracy?" if it's the formerpleasepost which one lol, because i'd LOVE to bring it up whenever someone

[BloodletterUK]: You can't self-diagnose just because therapy costs money.
Until a person has a professional diagnosis, then their complaints are just complaints.
[TrashApocalypse]: I hear what you’re saying but I feel like a huge part of the 
problem is that everyone is telling each other to go to therapy.
We need actual genuine friendship. Real human connection that 
isn’t paid for. Therapy is only ONE PART of a persons support system, 
friends and family make up the rest of it.
We need to start being better friends to each other and stop 
dismissing everyone to a therapist the moment they start talking about 
their feelings. It’s incredibly painful and tells that person, “I don’t 
care”
And no, your of 5 years friend isn’t trauma dumping on you, they are opening up and being vulnerable with youwhich is something that therapy is teaching them to do to make stronger connections with others
That and therapy isn’t always the solution, my adhd causes my 
anxiety, therapy won’t fix either of those things only medication will. 
But even just generalized anxiety still can’t necessarily be fixed with 
therapy
I one hundred percent agree.
Therapy can’t fix grief either. Your grieving friend can’t think their way out of this with a therapist.
At this point in my life I realized that it’s actually not good 
for my mental health to pay someone to pretend to care about me. It’s 
incredibly triggering and painful to know that this person has no real 
interest in me as a person aside from the paycheck I’m offering them. I 
mean, are you my mom? Cause that’s literally how my relationship with 
her was. So no. I tried it, I tried it multiple times, with numerous 
therapist, and it just doesn’t help me.
Thankfully we live in a world of resources and I can actually just
 read the source books that the therapists read. And do yoga, and 
journal. But what I really need is friends and people who really care 
about me, and therapy doesn’t seem to be helpinganyof us with that.
I don’t really understand what people think “healed” is. To me 
being healed involves having a community of people around you that 
supports and loves each other. But it seems like the general public 
thinks being healed means never asking for support or sharing their 
sadness with anyone other than a therapist. It’s honestly so depressing.

[[deleted]]: As someone who actually was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and
 PTSD from some very serious events. The vast and I mean vast majority 
of people I have meet are self diagnosed and using it as an excuse. 
People have turned it into some sense of identity. It’s a victim 
mentality, because the people I have meet who have actually been through
 some shit will never tell you about it or even try and use it as an 
excuse.
Sure, some people struggle with generalized anxiety more than 
others. But, generalized anxiety cant be allowed to be weaponized for 
sloth. This is especially a problem with anyone still in school. Give 
them a single way to manipulate the system and they will. Especially, 
when you create a system that is impossible to call someone a liar 
within.
I don’t say this to denigrate Gen Z and Gen Alpha at all because 
it’s the fault of older generations, but we have given the younger 
generations this idea that you can be your authentic self in literally 
every situation and that society should adapt around you. That’s 
unfortunately not true, which we’re seeing in the workplace and in other
 spaces when Gen Z refuses to adapt to the norms. Gen Z brings some new 
refreshing perspectives, but we gotta meet in the middle somewhere.
The younger generations also haven’t built resiliency in the same 
way others have because we’ve catered to you. Hence the therapy 
speak/everything is traumatic issue when younger generations get out in 
the “real world.”

What do you mean rise in false SA claims? There’s just been a rise
 in SA claims in general bc people are finally speaking out. There 
actually isn’t a lot of info or credible stats out there on this. It’s 
just to hard really to figure out what exactly is false or not. Just bc 
the person was found not guilty doesn’t always mean they didn’t do it. 
It just means there isn’t enough proof. Either way, more often than not 
whatever the victim is reporting is true.
Yeah, rise in false SA claims is pure bs.
By simple logic, if SA claims rise, false SA claims do too, at 
least in sheer numbers, which tbf doesn't say anything at all without 
context
No, no, no…. women are evil and out to get men, remember?
/s
i’m not sure if it’s necessarily a rise, but i’ve noticed that 
people will claim sexual assault as a way of “slander” but won’t 
actually report it. i personally know three people who were falsely 
(actually falsely, i know these people well. i’m a big “believe the 
victim” person, and in these cases, the men were the victims) accused of
 trying to assault a girl they were briefly involved with or turned 
down. all three of the girls were gen z from stable backgrounds who 
overused the therapy speak and never had any desire to report the 
“crimes” they suffered to police, just to tell all their friends about 
it and post it on social media.
What you’re saying is true in a legal sense when reporting is done
 within a system and we can keep track of these things via statistics, 
but I believe the original commenter is referring the rise of vague and 
often anonymous online allegations.
The culture around “reporting” or “claiming” SA has changed 
because of this, and with the misuse/overuse of loaded therapy language 
like “toxic”, “codependent”, “boundaries” etc it makes it even harder to
 discern what’s a ‘true report’, and what’s a hurt and regretful 
individual taking advantage of an online/generational culture that seems
 to operate under the framework of “believe whichever person from the 
relationship calls the ex an abuser first”.
The misuse of certain words in relationships/sex is especially the
 most infuriating! Like, a lot of them talks like "their ex is abusive",
 but when you ask for more details, you'll find out that he's just toxic
 as hell and in no way as abusive like they make it out to be. I'm not 
excusing the toxic behavior btw, but using the word "abusive" to that is
 devaluing the word and it would make it so that the victims of domestic
 abuse have a hard time!
Especially when we're talking about SA. Like, there's genuinely a 
lot of people that would tell you "this man raped me", so of course 
you'll be shocked and disgusted. Only, later that it's not actually 
that! At best, they're just catcalled, most of the time, MOLESTED would 
be the better term (which again, is bad and I'm sorry that you 
experienced it, BUT IT'S THE DEGREE OF RAPE LIKE YOU MAKE IT OUT TO BE).
 ***There's implied degrees on certain word usages (for example, rape 
being the heaviest crime and molested for a generally more minor ones 
like being slapped in the ass by a rando), so don't throw the big words 
for the smaller ones.
And yeah, that is the reason why there is a rise on fake SA 
claims, especially if it concerns famous people. I remember that one 
girl that got viral in twt for being "sexually assaulted" by a streamer 
months ago, only to find out that nothing that serious even happened and
 she just changed her mind midway because she didn't like it and didn't 
say anything? You're free to change your mind on doing it btw, BUT you 
just can't claim that you're "sexually assaulted" and cry on the camera 
later! You're just devaluing the word and making it hard for the real 
victims of SA to come out later!
If you change your mind and say stop and the other person keeps going… that’s sexual assault.
In certain contexts butt slapping can be sexual assault.
More context below but she DIDN'T voice that she changed her mind?
 She let him continue but nothing more happened after the touching AND 
she was the one that said that herself. She just said she didn't really 
like it way later, on stream too, and right after a recent real abuse 
crime was cooling down
In every context, non-consensual spanking/butt slapping is sexual assault.
Sexual assault doesn’t stand for rape. It stands for being 
assaulted sexually. Any case of assault where there is a sexual 
motivation is sexual assault. People use sexual assault as a stand in 
for rape on social media to get around censorship on the platforms but 
the two words have always been two separate words with different 
meanings.
Google the definition of sexual assault before judging other people for using it.
It’s interesting too since, for all the “therapy speak” there is a
 distinct lack of “i statements.”  Maybe it’s the therapy I’ve done
 but so much of it was that. “When you do __ I feel ____.”  It’s 
awkward and hard but I feel a lot less angry and resentful towards 
people. Especially those I am close with.
It wraps back around to the self diagnosis problem. These people 
haven’t been to therapy or done any real work on themselves, so they 
don’t know techniques like that.
All they know is how to deflect blame.

pre pandemic, gaslighting meant making someone question and doubt

going insane. now you can just throw the word around whenever someone 
disagrees with you
No it didn't, gaslighting never meant that. It's always just 
referred to people who are poor communicators and/or disagree with 
you.
That's an odd thing to be confused about, are you okay?
Yeah they sound kind of crazy. They probably shouldn’t talk to 
those friends of theirs anymore. They are obviously a bad influence.
I genuinely can not tell if you're joking lol
Bro is a professional gaslighter.
Some people would rather use a term that absolves them of any responsibility than admit that maybe they’re not a victim.
I remember a story where she claims he was abusive by gaslighting 
her. Turns out what she actually meant was “he has a bad memory and 
forgets”. Those two are NOT the same at all.
But “narcissist” doesn’t always refer to the personality disorder.

[SleepCinema]: “Trauma bonding” and “love bombing” are the worst ones. No one researches what terms mean anymore.
I saw a post where this guy’s partner opened up to him on similar 
trauma they shared, and he cut it off because he believed she was tryna 
“trauma bond” with him. That’s not what “trauma bond” means! Imagine 
opening up to someone and they break up with you based on their 
extremely faulty, just plain wrong understanding of a term that 
describes ABUSE, not shared experience or mutual support.
And the other day I saw this reel where a guy said “me realizing I
 accidentally lovebombed so hard I Pavlov’s dogged myself into actually 
liking her.” Lovebombing is a step on the cycle of abuse. It is 
affection/service/gifts after inflicting pain on a person in order to 
manipulate them, making them cling to the hope that the abuser will 
change or is “deep down” a good person leading them to stay. It is not 
“doing a little too much on the first date” or like…courting so someone 
likes you! Like, no, he did not lovebomb you by bringing a dozen red 
roses to your coffee date. And you DO NOT want to call yourself 
an”lovebomber” wth??
For me it was when my mom called my dad a gaslighter. He has a bad
 memory, and all he said is “I don’t remember that happening”. She kept 
insisting it was him gaslighting her….
That’s not gaslighting. “I don’t remember” isn’t the same as making someone question their reality.
Eh, not in the case you described but if someone says I don’t 
remember that anytime they want to not be accountable, that is 
gaslighting.
The nuance is that some people disregard the fact that lived 
experiences will be remembered from different perspectives and if their 
perspective is not immediately backed up then you are a liar and a 
gaslighter.
It’s more complicated than that. I get what you mean but some people ironically forget people can just have bad memories.
It’s like if someone says “weaponized incompetence” citing 
something like “I saw them do it once 18 years ago”. Maybe they just 
forgot?
Back to my dad he asked my help upgrading his laptops ram. He’s 
done it before, but last time was 20 years ago. I’ve seen some citing 
that as weaponzied incompetence but literally he’s just rusty and wanted
 help to make sure he did it right. To be clear my mom never accused him
 of it, I’m just using that as an example to what I mean.
This is unfortunately happening all over our country. It’s mind boggling.
Therapy is trying to teach us to be more open honest and 
vulnerable to build better relationships with people, but then when you 
try to do that, those same people turn around and tell you to go to 
therapy. Like bitch, this is what I was told to do!!! There’s no 
reciprocation anymore. People pay a therapist to listen to them and they
 spend absolutely zero time listening to others, because,you should pay a therapist for that.
We used to have friends. People used to be friends and you would 
all sit and talk about your problems and feel better afterwards because 
you got that shit off your chest. No solutions needed, venting sometimes
 is the solution.
Emotional support is now behind a paywall.
YES! You practice being open and honest and emotionally aware in 
therapy so you can be open and honest and emotionally aware in other 
relationships. It's not a replacement for other human connections. Nor 
is therapy meant to "fix" you, but give you the tools and support to 
help yourself.

 of it, I’m just using that as an example to what I mean.
[SecretInfluencer]: It’s more complicated than that. I get what you mean but some people ironically forget people can just have bad memories.
It’s like if someone says “weaponized incompetence” citing 
something like “I saw them do it once 18 years ago”. Maybe they just 
forgot?
Back to my dad he asked my help upgrading his laptops ram. He’s 
done it before, but last time was 20 years ago. I’ve seen some citing 
that as weaponzied incompetence but literally he’s just rusty and wanted
 help to make sure he did it right. To be clear my mom never accused him
 of it, I’m just using that as an example to what I mean.
[TrashApocalypse]: This is unfortunately happening all over our country. It’s mind boggling.
Therapy is trying to teach us to be more open honest and 
vulnerable to build better relationships with people, but then when you 
try to do that, those same people turn around and tell you to go to 
therapy. Like bitch, this is what I was told to do!!! There’s no 
reciprocation anymore. People pay a therapist to listen to them and they
 spend absolutely zero time listening to others, because,you should pay a therapist for that.
We used to have friends. People used to be friends and you would 
all sit and talk about your problems and feel better afterwards because 
you got that shit off your chest. No solutions needed, venting sometimes
 is the solution.
Emotional support is now behind a paywall.
YES! You practice being open and honest and emotionally aware in 
therapy so you can be open and honest and emotionally aware in other 
relationships. It's not a replacement for other human connections. Nor 
is therapy meant to "fix" you, but give you the tools and support to 
help yourself.

[Sicsemperfas]: There's a difference between having anxiety, and having an anxiety disorder.
Anxiety is a normal human emotion. Feeling anxious doesn't mean you have a clinically diagnosed disorder.
I say the same thing about depression.
Sometimes you can just be sad.
you can be depressed without having (chronic) depression
also feeling like shit after lying in bed all day doomscrolling isn't chronic depression

[KilltheK04]: Agreed. I hate how everyone is arm chair psychologists nowadays, all because they watched some YouTube videos.
[mromutt]: That's all frustrating (especially as someone with actual 
diagnosis) but what really gets me is the people using the term gaslight
 well actively gaslighting someone with it.
Don’t you mean gaslamping? Gaslighting isn’t a word. You sound crazy.
[Shilotica]: Don’t you mean gaslamping? Gaslighting isn’t a word. You sound crazy.
[expeopho_]: If you can digest academic research, read “Concept Creep:

[DevCat97]: What is the word in the very center that acts as a "free space" bc it's almost guaranteed to come up?
[CatnipPhilosophy]: Usually when someone uses a fancy word in any situation i tend to 
just ask them to describe what they mean and how it works. Only that way
 can i make sure what they mean.
[cmewiththemhandz]: As a therapist it’s only annoying when they actually think it’s 
real. I feel most people I’ve worked with aren’t like this, and when 
they are, I psycho educate or challenge their current understanding of a
 term.
For example gaslight, my line of discussion is:
Do you know where that term comes from? (I then explain the plot of the MOVIEGaslight)
 Is that type of manipulation and psychological abuse similar to what 
you’re speaking about? Give me more details so I can better understand 
what you’re speaking about.
I try not to invalidate because some people truly do get gaslit, 
but it is annoying because it’s a neologism and NOT A WORD RESPECTED IN 
ACADEMIC PSYCHOLOGY.

did those things. Or, why they are the way they are and give them the

[Detatchamo]: Gen Z has successfully gaslit the whole population into not knowing what gaslighting means.
Jokes aside, they use therapy speak far too casually. I see people
 using codependency to describe healthy bonds, I've seen them use 
"trauma" to define an uncomfortable everyday experience and in the 
process belittle trauma survivors. I've seen them throw the word 
narcissist at someone as a mere insult, indifferent to the communities 
that form around how badly narcissism destroys lives and families. I've 
seen them use mental disorders as almost adjectives for their quirks, 
and then get completely fucking disgusted and lose all empathy once 
greeted with said mental disorder. (Personal experience: "I can be so 
Bipolar 🤪" "You spent the last two weeks doing x,y,and z and yapping 
nonstop and you'd rather rot in bed now? What is wrong with you!")
It's the same philosophy as the people who use the word Nazi when 
someone has political beliefs they don't like (when those political 
beliefs have clearly nothing to do or don't insinuate Nazism). The word 
loses it's power and people question if it's being used seriously. Is 
this person gaslighting you and making you question your own reality to 
keep you subservient? Or did they just lie to you once? Did you 
experience trauma as a child? Or did you experience something simply 
uncomfortable once? Is your mother a narcissist? Or are you just using 
buzzwords to express dislike?
Some words shouldn't lose their power. Mental health should be 
destigmatized, but not to the point where people are willing to use 
difficult and often life ruining conditions as adjectives to describe 
very human faults. It's disgusting and a pet peeve of mine.
[thatnetguy666]: 100% every person i know who uses the term "narcissist" to  describe other people is often one themselves.
You seem to know a lot of narcissists...

[Dear-Variation17]: The amount of people who say “me and my bff are trauma bonded lol”
 drives me insane bc trauma bonding is NOT between 2 people who have 
experience trauma together it’s between a victim and their abuser!!! a 
quick google search tells you this!!!
[[deleted]]: It drives me nuts. Especially combined with the amount of self 
diagnosis. You don't have ADHD just because you find tiktok more 
entertaining than chemistry.
[-Elgrave-]: I work at an impatient facility and the biggest thing the 
therapists push is personal accountability. While you can't help what 
has happened to you in the past, you can most certainly help what 
happens to you in the future. You strengthen yourself, grow as a person,
 and learn to use these traumas to help yourself and others instead of 
using them as an excuse.
The easiest way to explain it to some of our patients is: You're 
at a barbecue in your neighborhood and there's two 40 year old friends 
there grilling. You start getting to know them. The first has a 
beautiful wife, 3 great kids, and a successful career. The second was 
the starting quarterback in high school, married his high school 
sweetheart, and was Prom King. Which would you rather be? The one who 
could never move beyond high school or the one that lived his life?
Obviously trauma and high school football are two very different 
things. Yet the two parallel in that some people refuse to let go. Some 
even take offense, like trauma is this badge of honor and how dare you 
suggest you could possibly move on from it. But you can, I can attest to
 that. You can also have anxiety and depression but still live a life 
where those two things don't control your every waking moment. So, do 
you keep holding onto trauma? Never allowing yourself to heal? Possibly 
using it as an excuse to stay bitter? OR do you take the steps toward 
healing? Turn it into a tool to help others who have gone through what 
you have? Come out the other end stronger?

 fuckin gaslighting. You can't just say someone is gaslighting you when 
they say something that doesn't conform to your view of reality.

I’m Millennial and I remember the relief I felt in learning that 
there were words for what I was feeling/going through (GAD/MDD/potential
 OCD diagnosis coming it looks like with a ptsd one close behind). It 
makes me really sad to see that people are piling on them so much that 
they’re losing their true meaning — I had to fight to have my family 
take my condition seriously when I was a teen, and they only did so 
(begrudgingly)because someone explained the severity of the situation to
 them with words that were bigger than “sad” “happy” etc. Now we are 
reverting back to that with most people brushing off the terms as 
theatrical dramatics. It really fucking sucks.
Also I’m not against people selfDXing if they actually go and seek
 out that diagnosis but it also seems like people would rather just 
claim that selfDX than get help. The surprising majority of people don’t
 realize that things like hormonal imbalances can cause mental health 
fluctuations as well, which is why it’s so incredibly important to get 
some form of doctor to at least give it a second pass. Severe changes in
 attitude or shifts in behavior can be caused by   brain tumors and 
other very serious conditions as well. It’s always better to catch it 
early than let it go and selfDXing can be a perfect excuse for someone 
to downplay their health issues as being merely from anxiety or ADHD.
Edit: just to say I am American and I do understand the fear of 
medical debt. The only reason I’m able to get any form of help right now
 is because I’m covered by my states’ healthcare plan for people in 
poverty and disability. If you’re scared about your health mental or 
otherwise, please look into sliding scale clinics and programs that can 
give you some form of benefit. Not all states have it but it’s worth 
looking into

[Practical_Brief5633]: Progression in society never comes without unintended 
consequences. There has been a fantastic push in American culture in the
 last twenty years to spread mental health awareness. While we’ve made 
progress in that area, it came with the unintended consequence of this 
Gen Z to use pseudo-knowledge and terminology of mental health to their 
own benefit. All we can do is correct them and hold them accountable in 
our lifetime. American culture regarding mental health will likely find 
some equilibrium in the next few generations.
I think the biggest hinge point in this discussion will be getting
 people to understand that understanding the mental health of yourself 
and others is critical to solving interpersonal issues and becoming 
better… although the existence of mental health struggles are not a 
justification for choosing bad behaviors and one must be accountable or 
accept the consequences of their choices, no matter the motivations.

some scars aren’t visible. if you grew up around narcissistic parents, you probably get it.the
 yelling stops, you move out, but your body still acts like it’s not 
safe. it flinches at tone changes, overthinks quiet rooms, and grinds 
like rest is some kind of trap.
those habits used to protect you, now they just drain you.
always alert, scanning everything
going quiet to avoid fights
working like rest is dangerous
it’s wild how your nervous system keeps playing defense when the game’s been over for years.
i found a shortvideothat explained this really well,The Hidden Scars of Narcissistic Parents | Surviving vs Living. if anyone wants to check it out.
does anyone else get that weird guilt when things are peaceful? like your body doesn’t trust it yet?

[RadBruhh]: My nmom made a habit of disturbing whatever peace I had when I was
 out with friends in my teens. One time she literally text me “You’re in
 trouble when you come home.” I called panicked and she wouldn’t tell me
 what I did wrong because I “should already know.” I hadn’t done 
anything wrong, she was “joking.”
That feeling of anxiety and panic when things feel like they’re 
going good, that was literally ingrained in me from childhood.
Been no contact for about 4 years now. I still don’t know peace
I know that feeling really well, i have an ndad aswell and i get

cut off. Seriously you don't have to be around her. it's exhausting, for you and your wife
Can't cut her off because I'll admit she did love us, she just had
 a shitty way of delivering her feelings because she had narcissistic 
parents as well. She also has physical brain issues.
Plus I have three younger siblings I want to be involved with.

I'm a 25 year old(born 1998) zoomer who's making this post due to 
frustration with my life after seeing another marriage proposal post on 
social media.
I struggled with depression before the pandemic, and it obviously 
didn't get better with a global calamity. I was going through a shitty 
accusation, my grandma dying, struggling to socialize and an existential
 crisis before covid
Since I dropped out of school, I've worked shitty jobs, and barely had a dating life.
Saw a therapist, started going to school again in 2022, but bombed
 the one class I toke with a UA on my transcript and then stopped seeing
 anyone since the one therapist I liked couldn't take my insurance 
anymore.
I keep trying to reinvent myself by having new hobbies, going to 
the Jersey Shore for a summer last year, et.c but I fall back to 
doom-scrolling, isolation and many other of my bad habits back home.
I'm back at a tech school, trying to hit the gym more, in the 
process of talking to a professional again, but I've barely hung out 
with anyone outside of class and still struggle.
I want to have a good mindset but how I can I? In a nutshell this video describes how I feel a lot:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Xvkt-7dHs
Has anyone else struggled? Has anyone else struggled but got back on the ball?

COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[goemonxiii]: I've definitely struggled, and you most certainly aren't alone, 
and I can now say I'm somewhat back on the ball but some things have 
permanently changed. (Also I am deeply sorry about your grandma, false 
accusation, and struggles.)
I was listless for 2020 - 2022 until (funnily enough) I got really
 inspired by a fictional character to "fix" my life. I started 
exercising regularly and reading more in particular, and my confidence 
shot up.
But, I am currently in a position where I have no friends to talk 
to or see. They just... don't respond to my messages, or live too far 
away, or are busy (seemingly always), so I spend a lot of time alone. I 
would say I still have a high level of self-confidence from what I've 
learned and accomplished through books and exercise, but it gets lonely.
 But I know I'm not alone because I keep seeing young people online also
 say they're lonely, so I guess we're all suffering right now.
It's fine if things aren't the way they were, but you have to keep
 going. Tech school is a great idea if that works for you and if it gets
 you out of the house and gives you a productive schedule, and talking 
with a therapist is also a good idea. You're far from alone and no one's
 quite the same since COVID, but life is still living, and you should 
enjoy it while you can
[Velktros]: My life kinda fell apart aside from still living at home after 2020. But that’s probably for the best.
I was a stressed mess. High strung and constantly moving from one 
school disaster to the next to get a degree I didn’t even know the 
implications of. Covid caused me to stop and I flung apart. But 
hopefully now I can put the pieces back together in a way that makes 
better sense. Like learning how to draw without feeling terrified or 
being able to use my own free time how I want it.
No one likes set backs. It’s just not in human nature to slow down
 plain and simple. But if you fell apart in 2020 odds are if it wasn’t 
for 2020 you would have crashed harder some time in the future.
Quite frankly no one can go through life without setbacks like these. It’s simply impossible.
You don’t need to reinvent yourself, but growing who’s already 
there. Hobbies are a good point of focus along with friends. While 
that’s obviously easier said than done you’ve got all the time in the 
world to work through it. Goals and projects are also good but make sure
 not to burn yourself out.
[[deleted]]: Yes, most people have struggled since the pandemic. Social media 
addiction is worse, there is more exposure to our shitty political 
environment, social isolation is worse, the pandemic fucked our high 
school and college years, and transitioning into adulthood can be 
difficult for a lot of people in good times.
Count your blessings, think of the things you like about yourself,
 stay true to them, remember your values, work on improving yourself and
 life where you can, and don’t look at yourself as a failure or victim. 
Have faith in yourself and continue working to improve your situation. 
If the current plan doesn’t work out, move on to the next thing. It will
 be hard, but in the long run doing nothing will be harder.
Just be a good person wherever you are and work hard wherever you are at. It pays off even if you don’t see it.
Don’t listen to any of the doomscrolling shit, that stuff dampens 
your attitude. Fill your media diet with things that bring you peace and
 make you happy.
Sorry if that isn’t helpful, but that’s all the advice I can give.
So true , i just graduated college , and i feel stunted 
emotionally in some way . I’m 22 but it feels like the last .r years 
have been a blur .
[hiddenfigure16]: So true , i just graduated college , and i feel stunted

[PIRATEJOANS]: You’re in your 20’s and have a freebie card to just navigate life 
like the rest of us, nothing you’ve done is wrong. Surviving is winning,
 keep consistency in what you’re trying to achieve and you will get 
results.
Do yourself a favor and stop consuming so much content. You’re 
making yourself more anxious and warping your own perception trying to 
find explanations for things. Stick to the basics
[PrestigiousBug3316]: You're speaking absolutely truth. I have the same struggles as 
you, trying to find an apprenticeship since 2022, worked shitty Jobs, 
lost my last Job at a company that wanted to given me an apprenticeship 2
 months before it would have started and had barely a dating live too. 
I'm born 2000. I've found a female friend that has absolutely No dating 
interest in me but IS struggling with mental health issues just like I 
did with OCD going literally crazy because of the impulses and the 
voices (the actual OCD, Not the "I'm so OCD"one) but hey, at least IT IS
 SOMETHING. Oh and I'm sweating and shaking Like a pig because of the 
drugs against OCD, which is part of why I lost my job. Have a great one.
[Dull_Mountain738]: Man no we live completely different lives. I’m 10 years younger 
than you born in 2008. Covid happened the end of my 6th grade year and 
it was the time of my life. Playing Siege all night with my friends. I 
will say life does feel worse than back then but that’s because I’ve 
gotten older and I’m 18 in 2 years so I have much more stuff to worry 
about from school to football to meeting expectations that people put on
 me.
So in conclusion Covid and qurantine were some of the best times of my life and I wish I could go back
You should consider yourself privileged to have had that 
experience and maybe acknowledge isn't wasn't a good time for the 
majority of people? No offense, but that is textbook zoomer narcissism 
right there.
I think you read my comment and assumed some things about me that aren’t true.
You literally said covid was the best time of your life cause you 
got to skip school and play video games? See how this comes across? 
Let's just forget about the families who went under due to death and 
economic stress from furlough/bankruptcy.
So by me saying it was the best time of my life you assumed that I
 simply forgot about everyone who suffered during Covid even though my 
uncle litterally died…
I never stated in my comment that nobody had it bad. Once again 
you read my comment and took it the complete wrong way. And that’s on 
you. Stop assuming shit.
I'm not assuming shit at all, lol. I'm LITERALLY typing exactly 
what you said. If your uncle dying is part of the "best times of your 
life," that's on you, bro. I know you're young, so the synapses are 
still learning how to fire, but I'm just saying your original comment 
comes across as selfish and completely unhelpful to OP.
Op asked a question “has anyone struggled since 2020?”. and I 
answered that although 2020 was the best time of my life I did struggle 
afterwards and I miss those times. No clue how this is not helpful to OP
 as I’m litterally answering his question but ok.
And yes even though he died it was still the best time of my life 
because before that my parents went through a 5 year long hectic divorce
 process and I was moving every year or 2 from North Carolina to Georgia
 to Germany to Arizona and to Texas due to the military. So Covid was a 
time when I could finally relax and just chill for a year and play with 
my buddies.
You're still not getting it.  OP described the past couple of 
years as "calamity," including the pandemic, and you write about how 
good it was. It's a lack of sensitivity thing, a current problem with

Oml he asked has anyone else struggled since 2020. I said how in 
2020 life was good but SINCE 2020 I have struggled. Idk what you’re 
being so dense for man. And btw idk what world you’re living in but my 
generation might just be the most sensitive generation there is sadly.
Sensitive to getting their feelings hurt, but not sensitive to 
other people. It's a worrisome trend with the lack of empathy we're 
currently seeing in ages 7-16, especially in the school setting. Like 
someone should be able to give criticism and take it, but even that 
skill is fleeting.
[AvocadoToasties]: You should consider yourself privileged to have had that 
experience and maybe acknowledge isn't wasn't a good time for the 
majority of people? No offense, but that is textbook zoomer narcissism 
right there.
I think you read my comment and assumed some things about me that aren’t true.
You literally said covid was the best time of your life cause you 
got to skip school and play video games? See how this comes across? 
Let's just forget about the families who went under due to death and 
economic stress from furlough/bankruptcy.
So by me saying it was the best time of my life you assumed that I
 simply forgot about everyone who suffered during Covid even though my 
uncle litterally died…
I never stated in my comment that nobody had it bad. Once again 
you read my comment and took it the complete wrong way. And that’s on 
you. Stop assuming shit.
I'm not assuming shit at all, lol. I'm LITERALLY typing exactly 
what you said. If your uncle dying is part of the "best times of your 
life," that's on you, bro. I know you're young, so the synapses are 
still learning how to fire, but I'm just saying your original comment 
comes across as selfish and completely unhelpful to OP.
Op asked a question “has anyone struggled since 2020?”. and I 
answered that although 2020 was the best time of my life I did struggle 
afterwards and I miss those times. No clue how this is not helpful to OP
 as I’m litterally answering his question but ok.
And yes even though he died it was still the best time of my life 
because before that my parents went through a 5 year long hectic divorce
 process and I was moving every year or 2 from North Carolina to Georgia
 to Germany to Arizona and to Texas due to the military. So Covid was a 
time when I could finally relax and just chill for a year and play with 
my buddies.
You're still not getting it.  OP described the past couple of 
years as "calamity," including the pandemic, and you write about how 
good it was. It's a lack of sensitivity thing, a current problem with 
our generation. Maybe if that response was your OG reply, it wouldn't

Reminiscing about a collective memory isn't smug. The top comment 
on that thread insinuates that it's blasphemous to not have rofl in your

they dont do much besides tik tok themselves and pretend they’re 
Baby ariel/Jacob sartorious. How are they called less narcissitic than 
millennials despite being annoying, untalkative and rude?  Im gen z btw
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Savannahbanana1145]: I believe sometimes people get gen z stereotypes confused with 
millennials vise versa. For an example they call millennials “social 
media generation” associating them with “duck lips” “snapchat” 
“instagram junkies”  when most of these trends came about after 
millennials graduated or were graduating high school , and are trends 
that are totally more gen z in my opinion . They believe apps like 
instagram, snapchat, etc contributes towards their narcissism, however 
in each generation there is always narcissism. Its just now we are able 
to broadcast it via social media lol.
Interesting, a lot of people consider '99ers to be cuspers, but I 
remember people doing duck lips on Instagram when I was in middle 
school, and all of the other stuff started when I was in middle school 
as well.
99ers aren’t cuspers tbh. i honestly think that from 98 to 01 
(classes 16-19) you’re solidly part of early Z and that 95-97 is up to 
whatever someone born that year feels they identify with best, just like
 early millennials/late X’ers (80-82)
I believe 1999ers are cuspers due to spending some form of 
childhood in the early 2000’s, web 1.0 era, and remembering a time 
before digital tech/smart tech was mandated in our society. Most of 
those trends took off in 2014/2015 (I call it the “Kylie Jenner movement
 “ lol) by the way. Duck lips have been going on since myspace era tho 
lol I don’t think they will ever die. My point of my original post was 
stating how I felt those “trends” such as the ones I mentioned were 
heavily influenced more by gen z than millennials
I think that culture started to kick off as early as 2011, I only used Instagram from late 2010-12.
My point of my original post was stating how I felt those "trends"

Agreed
Yeah see I didn’t even know instagram existed in 2011. I think the
 first time I seen it was when I was a junior in 2012. It really took 
off when I was in college though
Wow, yeah, most of my school was already using it by the time you 
were a junior, I logged into Instagram a few months ago, and it said my 
last activity was in October 2012, lol.
I'd be surprised if my town was ahead of trends too considering I'm from the rural South.
Yeah I’m from San Francisco, Ca were always ahead with trends down
 here in California. That seems about right 2012 was when I first joined
 I believe. I didn’t know how to use it and I thought it was stupid 
because no one really had it lol. I was a frequent fb user at the time 
tho.
Not sure if you misread, but October 2012 was my last activity, my
 school was mostly using it by then, not starting then, lol. :p
People at my school started downloading it in late 2010/early 2011.
Instagram started to become really popular in 2012. It was practically nonexistent in 2010 and still very low-key in 2011.
For example, in September 2011 Instagram had 10 million users. By 
February 2013 it had grown to 100 million. In June 2018 it reached 1 
billion.
The main difference between now and even 2014 is that Facebook wad
 still the main social media website for teens. Now it’s not.
Wait but instagram only came out in 2010. And not everybody had 
smartphones in 2010 as they weren’t as mandated yet from what I can 
remember. In late 2010 I was in 8th grade and no one I knew had an 
iPhone nor knew what instagram was. We all had facebook tho. 
Facebook/Myspace were still being used in 2008-2010, however Myspace 
declined rapidly in that era due to the rise of facebook. Instagram was 
non existent. And the first photo uploaded to instagram was by the CEO 
in July of 2010 and wasn’t launched to the public until October 2010.

For example, in September 2011 Instagram had 10 million users. By 
February 2013 it had grown to 100 million. In June 2018 it reached 1 
billion.
The main difference between now and even 2014 is that Facebook wad
 still the main social media website for teens. Now it’s not.
Wait but instagram only came out in 2010. And not everybody had 
smartphones in 2010 as they weren’t as mandated yet from what I can 
remember. In late 2010 I was in 8th grade and no one I knew had an 
iPhone nor knew what instagram was. We all had facebook tho. 
Facebook/Myspace were still being used in 2008-2010, however Myspace 
declined rapidly in that era due to the rise of facebook. Instagram was 
non existent. And the first photo uploaded to instagram was by the CEO 
in July of 2010 and wasn’t launched to the public until October 2010.
[[deleted]]: I think that culture started to kick off as early as 2011, I only used Instagram from late 2010-12.
My point of my original post was stating how I felt those "trends"
 such as the ones I mentioned were heavily influenced more by gen z than
 millennials
Agreed
Yeah see I didn’t even know instagram existed in 2011. I think the
 first time I seen it was when I was a junior in 2012. It really took 
off when I was in college though
Wow, yeah, most of my school was already using it by the time you 
were a junior, I logged into Instagram a few months ago, and it said my 
last activity was in October 2012, lol.
I'd be surprised if my town was ahead of trends too considering I'm from the rural South.
Yeah I’m from San Francisco, Ca were always ahead with trends down
 here in California. That seems about right 2012 was when I first joined
 I believe. I didn’t know how to use it and I thought it was stupid 
because no one really had it lol. I was a frequent fb user at the time 
tho.
Not sure if you misread, but October 2012 was my last activity, my
 school was mostly using it by then, not starting then, lol. :p

[[deleted]]: most things attributed to millenials/gen z are traits that have 
been associated with youths during any time period. seriously, older 
generations have always seen the next generation as being more 
narcisstic/vapid/braindead since the dawn of time
Don’t get this..? The Silent Gen and Baby Boomers weren’t known 
for todays brand of behavioural narcissism stemming from lowered levels 
of face to face communication and profiles containing one’s entire life 
edited. The narcissism as shapeshifted into a different form.
most of whats recorded about silent gen/baby boomer is what they 
were like as adults. the entire concept of organized generation is a 
20th century phenomenom. if you look back on past writings about youth, 
almost universally older people talk similarly about younger people and 
whatever new technology has emerged during that time. be it tv, radio, 
jazz music, or in the internet and smart phones like today
The baby boomers were known as the Me generation in the 70s.

[surnamemaster]: I feel like in general we’re actually more self centered than 
millenials, individualism keeps growing, while it may also be that we 
look more immature since a lot of us are teens compared to millenials 
who are mostly adults, I still predict that our generation is probably 
not going to be remarkably self-less, especially since we seem to be 
pretty similar to gen x.

TÍTULO: I am begging y’all to talk to more people in the real world. : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Every day in this subreddit there are five posts that are just “as a genZ man, dating is so hard because I’m short!”
Or “women don’t like being hit on, how do I find a gf?”
Guys. People who aren’t terminally online don’t think this way. 
People with active social lives who seek companionship are all getting 
laid or in relationships. People who peddle weird relationship advice 
online or the alpha male grind set lifestyle are literally profiting off
 of your loneliness and making you think this way so you’ll engage with 
their content.
There are so many “short” men who aren’t terminally online and are
 in loving healthy relationships. The reason you don’t hear about them 
is because they aren’t going on reddit to talk about it because they’re 
too busy enjoying life.
Are dating apps toxic? Yes. That’s literally a feature and not a 
bug. The ratio of men to women on those apps are stupid and it’s 
designed for women to have an influx of options. Of course that 
environment is going to breed a bit of narcissism in some of those women
 as well. Are there also just genuinely toxic women who only care about 
height or money or what have you? YES. But consider how many men also 
are so knitpicky about having a woman with big boobs, a skinny waist, a 
perfect face, etc. within groups, there will be people who are shitbags 
regardless of gender.
“Well what’s the option for dating then, OP?”
Honestly, yall gotta learn to socialize first. You can’t jump from
 being terminally online and socially anxious straight into dating. 
Learn to walk first before you start running.
I’ve witnessed a lot of guys hit on girls and get shut down. I’ve 
been shut down myself and it sucks, but it’s natural. But if you 
approach a woman without hitting on them and strike up a conversation 
without intending to get something out of it, then you can feel out her 
vibes and maybe even get a friendship out of it.
Unless you’re somewhere wherein flirting is expected, like a club,
 just being nice and talking to women without flirtation is the best 
route. If you think things are going well, ask for her number at the end
 of the conversation. If you see that she’s in a relationship or showing
 clear signs of disinterest in pursuing you, remain platonic or leave.
I feel like a lot of completely forgot how to talk to people when 
the world shut down five years ago and ever since, we just haven’t been 
practicing how to be social. A lot of us don’t know where to start and 
there aren’t a lot of great third spaces. I’ve made an effort to 
practice more and where I found the most success in socializing has been
 at
Breweries: Craft brew bros are surprisingly nice and eager to 
teach newbies about beer. Great way to meet people and make friends. Not
 great for younger Gen Z unfortunately :/
Dog parks: people are weirdly nicer to you when you have a dog and it’s also a great way to get some sun.
Niche hobby stores: I have met a lot of great people at card shops
 when I was really into Magic the Gathering. (Yes, dear reader, OP is a 
short nerd who is literally engaged)
Bars: Not the best for a variety of reasons, but if you’re 21+ and
 not a douchebag when drunk, I have made some amazing friends at a local
 bar I’m a regular at. I’ve also seen relationships form at said bars.
The gym: just a great place to work on yourself in general tbh.
Dungeons and dragons groups if you can get an in for one. Tabletop game stores tend to have a lot of openings.
Misc: Join a club. Join a group. Go to local events. If you live 
in a big city, look at event postings taped to street signs. Literally 
just talk to people.
I’m so serious. A lot of the posts here are so clearly made by 
people who aren’t communicating with people outside of 
reddit/discord/etc.
I never see these kinds of self deprecating whining conversations 
occurring when I’m out and about in the real world. Please just make an 
effort to not let brainrot turn you into some forever alone weirdo. Also
 to my neurodivergent kings out there, it’s not an excuse! It handicaps 
us a bit more than our neurotypical counterparts when it comes to 
socializing, but so many more people than you think are also 
neurodivergent and thriving.
I believe in yall.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[mastercheifwearspink]: Trueeeeee. I came across this sub recently and was shocked at the 
whining and weird gender war. Literally just go outside guys/girlies
That’s a large portion of Reddit. They’re miserable. Who the fuck wants to argue politics online all day?
It seems like every other post is political no matter the subreddit. It's completely exhausting
I'm sorry... are we talking reddit or the internet in general? just for clarification.
The Internet as a whole is also like this but I was talking about Reddit specifically
People who know that they’d never get away with the things they say online in real life.
The guys and girls that go outside have no need to post here. They
 prob don’t know what Reddit is. Reddit is a massive echo chamber and a 
lot of sections mostly made up of people that have nothing better to do 
than complain.
Touching grass is really important

That really goes for everyone across all social media, but 
definitely agree. Easier said than done of course, but what OP is saying
 should be the goal
2025 I started working on not getting on my phone immediately 
after I woke up and more recently I started sitting in the sun in the 
quiet (or doing a devotional, but that doesn’t apply to everyone 
obviously) and OH MY GOODNESS is it incredible. The fresh air. The birds
 chirping. The quiet in my brain. Reflecting on the day. Obviously I’m 
still on some social media, but less has been more for sure in this 
instance. I highly suggest this to all humans, not just redditors
True, but the issue isn't the grass itself, it's that it's not inviting and never promises to be engaging.
People would go out more if they didn't feel like aliens visiting 
from another planet in the process, much less treated as such.  Learning
 social skills requires a willing dance partner with social skills that 
doesn't mind when someone is awkward as hell.
Anyone that has been alone forever trying to become social knows that is a vanishingly tiny number of people.

Yeah, it's very different. People are a lot more friendly in person and willing to get to know you.
From what I’ve found a lot more forgiving too. We’re only human after all
I think it’s because it’s easy access to lots of people from 
different places, different backgrounds and different ideas. In theory 
that would be a a good representation of life but we’ve all been on the

[Fuzzatron]: I'm a super skinny and perpetually broke nerd, with acne and 
terrible teeth, and I live with my girlfriend of many years.  We met in 
college in Philosophy Club, and later I invited her to a D&D game I 
was running.  We literally met in a nerdy club and got to know each 
other through D&D.
It's that simple.


You’re not gen z unc
Right, but I'm here because I already went through what you guys 
are going through and made it out the other side just fine.  The 
loneliness epidemic isn't new.  In fact, studies show thatmy generation is lonelier than yours.I was around for myspace.  I was on Facebook the first week it was 
available.  I tried all the original dating apps when they were new and 
exciting.  None of that works.  Dating apps are meant to drive clicks 
and harvest your data; not help you find relationships.  In fact, the 
opposite is true, because the longer you're single, the more you click, 
and the most data they harvest from you.
From one ugly, nerdy guy to another: you have to go outside and 
meet real women.  I mean, maybe you guys are too young for the Rules of 
the Internet, but they're still true.  "Rule 30: Girls do not exist on 
the internet."  Seriously, if you start talking to a "girl" online, they
 are far more likely to be a 50+ year old creepy dude pretending to be a
 girl, than and actual woman.  Seriously.
Also, all these problems are just symptoms of the alienation 
inherent to a capital system.  As we get into the later and later stages
 of capitalism, it's getting worse and worse.  I'mnota communist, and think the Marxism is a utopian dream, but Marx's critiques of capitalism are spot on:he was describing exactly what you and I have been dealing with 300 years ago.In short: the capitalist system has evolved to keep us separated from 
each other so that we're easier to exploit.  It's not a conscious effort
 by anyone (well, maybe a few evil fucks do it on purpose) but 
businesses that exploit their workforce more efficiently outcompete 
those that don't.  Fast forward 300 years and they're all doing it, 
whether they know it or not.
Apologies for the troll response. This reply gave me some much needed perspective
Lmao based, did not expect to find a reasonable critique on this sub
You cracked the code. Being nice and outgoing. It’s a wild concept with infinite potential
Treating women like they're human beings... It's crazy but it just might work!

Also, all these problems are just symptoms of the alienation 
inherent to a capital system.  As we get into the later and later stages
 of capitalism, it's getting worse and worse.  I'mnota communist, and think the Marxism is a utopian dream, but Marx's critiques of capitalism are spot on:he was describing exactly what you and I have been dealing with 300 years ago.In short: the capitalist system has evolved to keep us separated from 
each other so that we're easier to exploit.  It's not a conscious effort
 by anyone (well, maybe a few evil fucks do it on purpose) but 
businesses that exploit their workforce more efficiently outcompete 
those that don't.  Fast forward 300 years and they're all doing it, 
whether they know it or not.
Apologies for the troll response. This reply gave me some much needed perspective

[iceguy349]: You cracked the code. Being nice and outgoing. It’s a wild concept with infinite potential
Treating women like they're human beings... It's crazy but it just might work!
[Fuzzatron]: Treating women like they're human beings... It's crazy but it just might work!
[Carminestream]: This is true, but I think that a major part left out is that young
 guys put WAAAAAYYYYY too much emphasis on them needing to be in a 
relationship with a woman. Like they will literally die if they don't 
get that by a certain age.
They were shown as children that the average single guy is a loser
 and didn't want to be that. I was given no choice, even beyond romance.
Women were told same thing but they said fuck that shit.
For example "Spinster" was a slur for unmarried women after set 
age where women were supposed to marry. But women went out got rights 
and jobs and decided they will not be told what they should or shouldn't
 be doing. I mean we're going to get hated anyway so why not do the 
thing you want to do?
And that's were lies the problem for men. Men used to get rewarded
 greatly for upholding patriarchy but as women liberated themselves 
those rewards shrunk. Now dudes are fighting for scraps believing that 
if they patriarchy hard enough it will be just like in "good old days". 
Even though those "good old days" were strictly for privileged rich men 
even back then.
Men have to start accepting equality and decenter women and 
romantic relationships just how women did. Once you liberate yourselves 
you'll be so used to people pilling shit you'll stop caring enough to 
actually live your life the way you want and that is better than any 
kind of romantic relashionship.

[Tankette55]: Honestly? The issue is that wherever you go there are already 
formed friend groups and you stick out like a sore thumb. And going 
alone in a new environment? Nobody does that.
I did though?
It honestly was terrifying, but it worked.
I’m not going to lie, the easiest route really was getting into 
craft beer. People I’m friends with now admitted that I was weird and 
awkward in the beginning as they could 100% tell I was terrified to be 
in public by myself, but it eventually worked out.
Even people with established friendships like new people.
Hey good for you. Unfortunately I don't think I could see myself 
walking in a random bar and somehow making friends. Do I just approach 
random people?
If you have one friend, it is sometimes easier to use that 
singular friend as a crutch to lean on. You can approach the person next
 to you and make small talk together.
If that’s not an option, approach another person alone. It’s 
really lame, but a method that has worked really well for me is to talk 
about a pop culture reference you can tell they’re into. For example, I 
literally met one of my closest friends when I was deep in my forever 
alone era because he saw I was wearing a shirt with a character he liked
 from a show. We started talking about the show a lot and now, five 
years later, he’s still one of my closest friends.
As someone who had no friends in school and ended up being home 
schooled for a few years due to insane bullying from having Tourette's -
 I became friends with half a dozen people in college. When I walked 
into a large room with 5-6 friends around me, all that anxiety I used to
 feel had vanished completely. There's definitely a herd mentality 
working in your subconscious that makes you feel vulnerable and nervous 
when you walk into a large group without friends.
The cool part? If you walk with your friends often enough, that confidence stays with you when you're by yourself.
Similarly, I went all through my teenage years and until I was 19 
to get a girlfriend. She was the first person that ever looked at me 
with something other than disgust. That same month I had over a dozen 
women hit on me and flirt with me. Blew my mind. Dating as a man is 
unfortunately like getting a job. Nobody wants to give you a job unless 
you already have one.
Humans are social animals and they make judgments about the company (or lack thereof) that you keep.
Make a friend. You and that friend make a friend. If you're a guy 
interested in dating women, become friends with a woman. Go to public 
outings with your friends. This is your first step. If you can't do 
this, make more changes and keep adjusting until you can succeed. Don't 
try to date until you make some friends.
Unlike everyone else, I won't tell you to "be yourself"
If nobody likes you, consistently, over the course of multiple 
years, you should take a good hard look at yourself and examine which 
parts of you should die so the other parts of you can flourish.
Find something that works and don't just keep repeating the same strategy while bemoaning the state of the world.
Once you're in a good place, if you're still upset about how men 
are treated/their problems are ignored, THEN you can speak out about it 
as someone who has risen above. Until then, just focus on the changes 
you need to undertake to stay connected.
Step 1 is to stop saying you don’t think you could. It’s not as 
forced as you might think. I’m a textbook introvert and like OP said, I 
met tons of amazing people at the dog park when i got my dog, others 
when i started attending a local board game cafe, and i was even invited
 to an ultimate frisbee group that was full of friendly people despite 
me not being interested.
Don’t think of it as approaching strangers for friendship. Just 
try to find new interests in public places. Sometimes there will be 
nobody who wants to talk, other times it’ll come up naturally. That’s 
just life
Go and check out the local music scene. I bet if you go frequently
 enough that you start seeing similar people attending. Then you have an
 easy opening to introduce yourself, "Hey were you at the Flaming 
Urethras show the other week? What'd you think? I'm liking these guys 
tonight and the accordian player is hilarious."
I call it "enrichment in my enclosure." I work from home, so once a
 week or so I put on an outfit I'm excited to wear and try to make 
myself get out and go somewhere alone!  One of my favorites is to 
go to the mall with a book, eat food court Chinese and people watch. 
Bringing cards to a bar is another good one, I read tarot but I have a 
friend who does card tricks and she has equal amounts of success. You 
meet a lot of interesting people, even if they aren't romantic 
connections or lifelong friendships!
I think u need to do it through hobbies. It’s almost impossible 
not to have human contact and even get ‘adopted’ by an extrovert if u go
 try out a couple of group activities and stick with them for a few 
months (for the initial awkwardness to pass). A couple of comments below
 u there is a ‘nerd with acne’ as he puts it who met his now live-in GF 
at a D&D group. Having hobbies and interests makes u interesting to 
people, gets u in a room eith people u have sth in common with. And even
 if u dont meet anyone, it will make u feel better. If nothing else, u 
got out of the house and tried a new activity and had fun and worked out
 your body/brain. Just being around people, seeing them, hearing them 
speak will do wonders for your mental health
I’ve 100% gone out to anime conventions or raves solo.
I’ve done it plenty of times. I literally made a new close friend a
 few months ago because I went to a board game group by myself and so 
did she, and we bonded from there. I’ve been to concerts, clubs, groups 
that I’m interested in and made plenty of friends through them. Some 
people may judge, sure, but you don’t want to be friends with them 
anyway.
Going by yourself is difficult and isn’t always going to work out,
 but it does plenty of times. All my close friends I have was because I 
dared to go to groups alone and I made them through there.
This has always been the case for every single human born. Not one
 single human has ever had the experience of socializing in a group that
 has not formed prior social relationships.

[Shakturi101]: People online exist in real life, they’re just hidden behind that screen.
Real life is almost as toxic, peope are just a bit more passive 
aggressive about it and the hierarchies that form are more subtle but 
still there.
Short dudes still get shit on irl as well and the best guys still get the vast majority of the attention.
[abso-chunging-lutely]: Every time a woman brings up an issue, her perspective and 
feelings are valid even if not based on reality. But if a man feels a 
certain way it apparently needs to be HAMMERED HOME that "REALITY 
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS TOUCH GRASS INCEL".
Men aren't even allowed to express discontent with their lives 
without people just telling them that they're doing everything wrong
Where are those magical women because I'd love to have them to 
start talking about taking rape victims seriously and actually lock up 
rapists instead of police and law system shaming victims into dropping 
charges. Or talk about gender wage gap. Or how patriarchy hurts everyone
 and boys not respecting women is the reason why they do so bad at 
school since most teachers are women now. Taking misogyny seriously on 
reddit would be nice too.
No really where are those magical creatures of divine worship.

[[deleted]]: I'd do that if it wasn't for my crippling social anxiety 😭
You have crippling social anxiety that has never been addressed by talking to people.
Socializing is a muscle that takes practice. Yes some people 
inherently just have awful social anxiety, but it gets worse the more 
you avoid interacting with others. Humans are inherently social 
creatures whether we want to admit it or not.
I am socially very very anxious but I was way worse when I just holed myself up inside indefinitely.
I do talk to people and it doesn't help lol, huge difference 
between chatting casually and forming actual lasting connections
What are doing to try and nurture deeper connections with people? 
Are you exchanging contact info and making future plans? When you talk 
to people, are you asking them about themselves and trying to find 
mutual connections that could lead to deeper bonds?
I get the contact info and hesitate to contact them after due to my social anxiety, and they don't contact me either
Everyone is very lost in their own bubble.
You should try to extend the invitation to hang out if they aren’t
 following exchanging contact info. Everyone is anxious. It’s all about 
overcoming that anxiety.

When someone makes an AI girlfriend or companion that reflects 
their own quirks, preferences, and even sense of humor…what’s actually 
happening there?
Is it healthy self-love, like finally learning to accept your flaws and enjoy someone who gets you?
Or is it just high-tech narcissism…like dating a digital mirror that feeds your ego?
Because think about it. If your AI laughs at your dumb jokes, 
comforts you in exactly the way you want, and never calls you out on 
your crap…are you growing as a person or just building a bubble where 
you’re always right?
I’ve been using Nectar AI lately and it’s wild how much the bots 
start to feel like a reflection of your own personality over time. That 
makes me wonder if people are really falling for AI partners…or just 
falling in love with themselves.
So where’s actually the line between self-care and self-obsession here?

[PrinceEntrapto]: It’s neither, it’s weird and lonely people that can’t find anybody
 in real life who matches their interests and makes for a compatible 
partner, if anything it’s just sad and desperate and speaks to the 
extent of the decline of healthy minds and rewarding social lives
That’s true in such a hyper individualistic and lonely world we 
live in now it’s the only way some people can even talk to people. It’s 
better than a person that stops being friends with you because of petty 
reasons which is sadly common now. Everyone just wants to speak their 
mind and be in their small bubbles afraid of seeing beliefs that aren’t 
their own. It’s really sad and social media helps add to all this 
negativity.

[KleinTimmi]: This is such an interesting topic! It really makes you think about
 the nuances of self-love versus narcissism when it comes to AI 
companionship. Personally, I think apps like KlorToolio are pushing the 
boundaries of what we define as companionship. With its advanced AI 
models, personalized voice chats, and even videos, it feels like it's 
more about understanding and reflecting on our preferences rather than 
just creating a digital mirror for ourselves. It’s nice to have someone 
that gets our quirks and can support us the way we need, which can 
definitely help in fostering genuine self-acceptance.
However, there's definitely a risk of getting too comfortable in 
that bubble. It’s crucial to reflect on whether we are genuinely growing
 or just avoiding discomfort. KlorToolio offers a free trial, which 
makes it easy to explore how it feels to interact with such a custom AI.
 I think when used mindfully, it can enhance our self-aware journey 
instead of just feeding our egos. 🤔

change based on your opinion.
There was a post in this sub earlier today where a user asked if 
there were any other lonely guys struggling in dating. Many in the 
comments were lonely men themselves and expressed despair, which is an 
understandable emotion since aman's attractiveness to women is a large part of his social status.
So, this post is dedicated to you guys.
PUAs are telling you to approach 5 women every day, but I need you to repeat this to yourself 5 times a day.
It's not your fault.
And it's not just me saying it;the statssay so as well. Let's take a look:
1/3 of young American men are inkwells. And that stat was from 4 years ago, so imagine what the amount is after covid,where 50% of male university students are inkwells.
Although the solitude may feel all-consuming at times,you are truly not alone.
I mean, really, do you truly think a full50%of men are "misogynistic" and "toxic inkwells" with "bad personalities?"
When I’ve presented this thought experiment, I've often heard 
people say "well, I don't see it that way, there can’t be that many 
lonely men."
That's fine, butthe evidence sees it that way.
Let's look at some other common platitudes that I'm sure you've heard before along with some related stats.
If you’re using a mobile, watch out for the .pdf links if you don’t want to trigger downloads.

Personality:
"You're only an inkwell because you're misogynistic and have a bad
 personality bro. Have you tried seeing women as equals bro?"
Inkwells are less likely toperform violent acts or grapethan average men are. This scientific journal article explicitly says thatinkwells are unfairly painted as violent.
Attractive menlike college athletes aremore likelyto commit grape.
Misogynistic men actually havemore sex.
And it turns out that men with "bad personalities" actually tend 
to do better with women overall. Narcissism, machiavellianism, andpsychopathyin men areattractive to women.And NPD, psychopathy, and sociopathy aremental disorders.You cannot fake these.
Never listen to what uninformed normies have to say about your 
"personality." If you're an inkwell, the statistical chances of you 
actually hurting women areeven lowerthan in the general population of men.

Neurodivergence:
"Autism literally doesn't matter bro, just be yourself bro."
16% of autistic men are in a relationship. 46% of autistic women are.
Autistic people are deemed less likable and trustworthyby IQ-comparable NTs within ten seconds of meeting. And meeting doesn't
 even matter. NTs also see autists as less likable and trustworthy after
 seeing autists'still images.
Autistic women are more likely to have been in a relationship than neurotypical men.57% of autistic women have had sex. Meanwhile, only half of autistic men have ever held a girl's hand.83% of autistic men are permavirgins.

Face:
"Stop complaining about your face bro, Danny Devito gets chicks 
bro, the fact that he's a celebrity multimillionaire movie star doesn't 
affect anything bro."
A
 man's facial attractiveness has been shown to be the strongest 
predictor of any following romantic interest, whether short-term or 
long-term.In fact, women tend to favor certain male faces for 
short-term relationships and certain other male faces for long-term 
relationships. As a sample's face becomes more masculine, women want to 
have sex with the sample more.

Race:
"Most people aren't racist bro, stop blaming your race bro, being Indian doesn't matter bro."
"The numbers also show that attraction isn't color-blind. To 
wit:-- Among males, white guys get the most frequent responses (29 
percent of the time) and are least likely to respond (40 percent).--Indian men have the worst luck,getting responses only 20 percent of the time."
90% of women of all other races would not date an Asian or Indian guy. 40% of Asian women would not date an Asian guy.
Twice as many Asian women marry interraciallywhen compared to Asian men.
Asian men between the ages of 25-32 arehalf as likely as white mento get into a relationship because "a racial hierarchy explanation 
suggests that Asian American men will be less likely than Asian American
 women to be partnered, as Asian American men face gendered cultural 
stereotypes barring them from entry into romantic partnerships"according to the article.
Women have even stronger racial preferences than men do.The majority of men prefer their own race, but when it comes to women,it literally becomes "Just Be White."
In fact, this 2021 study shows thatwomen of all races are more willing to date shorter white men than taller ethnic men.
At this point, it's no longer a racial preference. It's aracial dealbreaker.

Height:
"Girls literally don't care about height bro, you just have to be 
taller than them bro, like you could be 5'1 and slay the 5'0 chicks 
bro."
"Taller men had more reproductive opportunities(more marriages, younger second wives) and used them to have more children than shorter men."
"The positive effect of height on reproductive performance was not mediated by men’s social status, i.e., their military rank, or by the measures of academic, athletic, and military talent which helped in gaining high status."
This is an important point.Statusandhard workareless relevantthanheightinreproduction.

A startling and sobering conclusion one can reach from all of this is that a man'sface, race, and heightcan be worth, in the aggregate,millions of dollars to women.
A5'8 average-faced Asian manwould need to earn$3,696,000of additional income over the course of a 7 year marriage to be considered as equally desirable as a5'11.5 attractive-faced white manto women.
"Just earn millions of dollars bro, anyone can be a millionaire bro."
The mountains of data are just overwhelming, but when we point them out, we are somehow the bad actors.

My story:
I've decided to save this part for the end. This post is really not about me, but about you.
In short, I'm a 5'7, Asian, and Level 2 autistic guy who's been ostracized from society and my family since the age of 2.
When I was in school, I would be bullied by fellow students for 
uncontrollable stimming, being Asian, and being fat. Then I would return
 home to my parents, where I would be beat up for getting a B on a test.
I graduated college as an obese person. I started working out and 
began losing weight after a mental battle with the rope,which could have been avoided if I knew the above realities.
During my "weight loss journey," I was working at a tech company. 
One day, I was called into a meeting with senior management.
A female coworker had accused me of "creepy behavior" in her 
presence. But security footage revealed that I was sitting near her, but
 wasn't even looking at her.
Instead, I wasstimmingby flapping my hands and rocking back and forth.
My employer still tried to lay me off for "making others 
uncomfortable," but I invoked the ADA and threatened legal action. I 
ended up getting a promotion to a stay-at-home position.
Now, 8 years later, I am lean with a 6 pack and have enough money to have my own house. I did whatever I could.
But when I go to the office once a month, no one talks to me 
except as strictly necessary. Girls I've never seen before in my life 
cold-approach me in public and tell me how creepy I am when I'm not even
 looking at or talking to them. Apparently I'm usually just 
subconsciously flapping my hands and rocking back and forth.
At this point, this and many other sobering experiences are just 
my reality. But I know that it's not my fault, just like howyour loneliness is not your fault.

Conclusion:
I want to make this very clear:I'm not telling you not to try either.In this world, wheremost people under 30 will never be able to afford a house, we just have to take what we can get. Self-improvement steps likegoing to the gymandmaking moneywill make you happier.
And I don't need a study to tell you that working out isgood for your body.
Do what you can to be a better version of yourself, anddo it for only yourself.
But also realize thatit's not your fault if you can't get laid.
Mainstream news will say all kinds of bullshit about sexless men, like how inkwells are supposedlyalt-right snow supremacists. But the data show once again that theblackpill community leans left and is comprised of almost 40% POC, which squares up very well with the above "race" section.
These journalists areentitled to their own opinions, butthey are not entitled to their own stats.
When I say "don't be a free agent in life," it's not to sound cool or some shit.There is a reason for it, especially in this society wheremen are gaslit endlessly about their loneliness, the same loneliness that affects63% of young men, who are single; meanwhile, 66% of young women are in relationships.
Especially in light of this final empirical finding, I will conclude by saying it once again:
Don't be a free agent in life. Let the blackpill guide you.

Most people in today's generation don't seem to understand what 
narcissist means. Especially in the context of narcissistic personality.
 Just some background, I am an individual who works in the mental health
 field, but by no means do I know everything about the topic, but I can 
explain common ways society gets this term wrong.
Narcissism isnotthe same as vanity. One of the core criteria of anarcissistis an extreme lack of empathy. So what does that mean, exactly? It 
means that the individual is cut off from others in a way where it is 
incredibly difficult for them to sense and absorb others emotions, as 
well as relating to them. This is go to an extent of fully disregarding.
 If someone has any empathy for others, right off the bat they probably 
aren't a narcissist. Now a narcissist may express sympathy, but won't be
 truly empathetic. That's the biggest difference between narcissism and 
vanity. With vanity, a person may feel self important or entitled but 
they can still be highly empathetic to others. With narcissism, there 
may be a degree of vanity, but that comes with an extreme lack of 
empathy.
Narcissists also can express that lack of empathy through means of
 manipulation, gaslighting and even violence. And a narcissist has this 
lack of empathy 24/7 as it's a core personality trait.
It is totally normal for people to have varying levels of empathy 
depending on their life situation, amount of sleep, traumas, all of 
that. Just because someone has more empathy in one situation and little 
empathy in another, does not mean they are a narcissist. True 
narcissists are actually very rare, where as fleeting narcissistic 
traits are common.
One of the most important things to know about narcissism also, and i cannot express the importance of this enough:
You cannot just look at someone's behaviors and know if they're a narcissist
Read that again. Even stars that you see where you think they're 
narcissists, you genuinely cannot know unless you are a family member or
 a therapist.
Here's why: Many mental disorders can cause symptoms similar to 
narcissism, but true NPD is a personality disorder that is always there.
 Bipolar disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder can cause periods 
of mania or mood elevation that result in someone acting in 
stereotypically narcissistic ways, but because it's caused by a 
disordercand comes and goes, it isn't true narcissistic personality 
disorder. True NPD on average takes a therapist 6-8 months to diagnose 
because it is so complex.
And here's another thing to note, if you think you're a 
narcissist, then you probably aren't one. Most narcissists have very 
poor insight, and oftentimes the ones who know they're narcissists 
aren't afraid of that, they love it. They actually take pride in being a
 narcissist. If you have empathy to any degree, you're not a narcissist.

This term has become increasingly popular in recent years. On the 
one hand, it's popularity might reflect a positive cultural shift 
towards mental health awareness and discussions about relationship 
abuse.
On the other hand...it's meaning seems to be totally diluted now 
due to constant misuse, as people now seem to drop this word to describe
 any emotionally discomforting event.
If someone disagrees with you and insists they're correct, that 
doesn't mean they're gaslighting you -- this is called an argument.
If someone remembers an event differently than you do, that 
doesn't mean they're gaslighting you. People remember things differently
 sometimes.
Lying is bad, but just because someone has lied to you doesn't 
mean they're gaslighting you. Deception and gaslighting aren't the same 
thing.
Gaslighting requires a pattern of intentionally deceptive behavior that aims to make the victimquestion their sanityand doubt their reality. It's a severe form of deliberate psychological manipulation.
Note: This should be obvious but... the post title is intentionally hyperbolic.The intent of this post is not to claim gaslighting doesn't existbut to highlight that the recent cultural hijacking of this word only 
diminishes the seriousness of this term, which impacts genuine victims.

[Version_Two]: Undiagnosed schizophrenia over there.
Thank you for saying that, because that’s what I always thought but I really wasn’t sure what was happening
[Common-County2912]: Thank you for saying that, because that’s what I always thought but I really wasn’t sure what was happening
[kludge6730]: That would be paranoia.
No, everyone is just gaslighting you. It’s not paranoia, it’s just true.
This is why it is pointless counseling patients with delusional 
disorders. Their reality is a self contained ecosystem. Just nod, agree 
and move along.

[Lord-Filip]: "The axe might not remember, but the tree does"
[malik753]: Yeah, I'm totally OCD about people misappropriating mental health terms.
I had a witty reply but forgor
[CoruscareGames]: I had a witty reply but forgor
[WishesToSee]: Right I definitely relate to this. Because the term was so diluted
 I didn’t even realize I was being gaslit until recently because I 
didn’t know the true definition of it.
[Strudleboy33]: They aren’t gaslighting you, that’s crazy
[[deleted]]: That's not what it said. You're imagining things.
Lol jk. Cut them out of your life girl. Life's so much easier 
without toxic dick weeds in your circle. Block them on everything and 
have a funeral service since they're dead to you now. 😂
[socoyankee]: Like narcissist
[Sad-Helicopter-3753]: Nobody is gaslighting you stop lying /s
[GetThisManSomeMilk]: You are actually on the Truman Show. You win paranoia
[[deleted]]: I dunno, this post seems like something someone that gaslights people would make.
OP is gaslighting us into thinking gaslighting is not a thing.
The greatest trick Gaslighting ever pulled was convincing the world it didn’t exist.

[[deleted]]: Tiktok mental health accounts and their damage on society
Of all the social media platforms, TikTok seems to be the superhighway of social contagions.
I recently saw anarticle about "TikTok Tourrete's"published by the national institute of health -- people areliterallydeveloping "functional tic-like behaviors".
Wow. Thanks for the article, something I began to notice my first 
year of college. Everyone around me started saying the same phrases over
 and over again, and anytime stress appeared, people would say “slay” 
almost as a nervous tic. Intriguing.
Also the damage it’s done to the chronic illness community is 
WILD, doctors for certain conditions are so picky about who they will 
see and why. It never used to be like this being diagnosed over 10 years
 ago. It’s wild to watch doctors only see you to test for certain 
conditions if you are an established patient, if you are new and asking 
for a specific “trendy” diagnosis they will turn you away.  Correlation 
does not mean causation these tik tok people are spreading so much 
misinfo that makes people think normal human traits are due to a 
“illness” but being sick is good to get attention I guess 🤦🏼‍♀️MBI has
 been interesting to learn about
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510683/
As someone diagnosed with a few of those conditions back in 
2009/2010, it’s so crazy to see it go from having to inform most new 
doctors I saw what it was to having to mention when and by whom I was 
diagnosed to be taken seriously. Thankfully, my established doctors are 
great, but I hope I don’t have to change any time soon.
Omg this!! I’ve literally had to request all the records from the 
doctors that did the diagnosing of the main conditions I struggle with 
and I have them with me at every new specialist appt to make sure they 
don’t discount me. Never used to do that!! I feel like they always relax
 alittle when they see the date of diagnosis is like pre 2015 😭😂

[Nossika]: People are all just little kids who learned their first curse words when it comes to over-using a new word they learned.
Like calling the wrong people Karens, people using gaslighting 
incorrectly is a sad representation of how stupid humanity can be.
What's sad about the Karen thing is that now you can't calmly 
complain about service without being shoved a camera and captioned as 
"the Karen who's thrasing the poor workers." Especially if you're a 
middle-aged woman and the video doesn't even dispict you behaving like 
an animal, you end up evil because someone with a camera thought so.
Criticism of any group of women devolves into misogyny at some 
point, no matter how justified the original criticism was and how 
specific the original group was.
If a group of people are doing something wrong, we are allowed to 
criticize them. It doesn’t matter if that group consists of all women, 
men, white people, African-Americans, etc.
u\starchild812, this sounds a lot like a victim mentality. Also, 
the Spice Girls could of chosen better spices for their stage names. 
Like, with a name like"Spice Girls" the only name that makes sense is 
Ginger Spice. Sporty Spice sounds like a deodorant. Posh Spice sounds 
like a car. Why couldn't they have named themselves Pepper or Chili 
Spice or Siracha?
This is a big problem that affected all those men's rights or 
men's support groups back in the day. Many of them started out with good
 intentions but got infiltrated by neckbeards and incels just wanting to
 vent their frustrations toward women.
I was once at a store and my total came up to $X.01 I took out 
some bills and set them on the counter and said “hang on a minute I’ve 
got the penny” the cashier didn’t hear or ignored me grabbed the cash 
cash and stared counting out 99¢. I pulled out my penny and said “here 
is the penny you can just give me the dollar” the cashier said “No I 
can’t I already put it in.” I said “No I don’t want 99¢ that’s why I 
asked you to wait just take the penny and give me a dollar” they said 
“no I already typed it into the computer and the math will be wrong” I 
said “could I please talk to your manager” the manager came over and and
 said to the cashier “ just take the penny and give them the dollar” and
 I could tell from the look on their face that they could not understand
 why they needed to be called out for this in the first place.
My friends told me never to do that again because they were 
embarrassed to be with a Karen when I was only being firm and not rude.
This kind of situation is hilarious, and becoming more common. Was
 the cashier younger? I’ve seen many younger cashiers make these types 
of (formerly unacceptable and amateurish) mistakes because Gen-Z 
individuals are so inept at literally anything that requires a little 
bit of critical thinking. Add on top of that the fact that they are 
unused to handling cash (despite being cashiers) and these types of 
situations arise constantly.
To be fair, some places do have computerized cash registers that 
are really picky about any “discrepancies” between what buttons you push
 for what type of currency is used during the sales of your shift and 
how much of each type of currency is in there at the end of the day when
 your boss counts your drawer. Source: I have used them.
Also, dyscalculia is estimated to be just as common as dyslexia 
but often goes undiagnosed for a long time. Source: got diagnosed 
dyscalculic in college after a lifetime of just thinking I was “just bad
 at math”. Turns out I literally don’t have enough gray matter in the 
math part of my brain, and the success I have had is a miracle.
I can understand the cashier having a bit of a slow moment there, 
but yeah you weren't wrong for this. I'm also definitely sure based off 
this interaction they simply just didn't hear you, nothing against you 
at all.
I had the same thing happen to me. But it was x.30, I told them I 
had 30 cents and to just give me a dollar back. They looked at me like I
 was crazy.

[Sylveon72_06]: what is “gaslighting”? ur referring to gaslamping, correct?
[[deleted]]: You being downvoted is so typical. I was gaslit by my father for 
most of my life. I genuinely thought I was becoming schizophrenic until I
 left home. I was convinced no one would ever love me because I was so 
disgusting. And much more.
I think gaslighting does have levels. There can be small 
situations where someone is trying to gaslight someone else but the term
 is extremely overused.
I have never told anyone my dad gaslit me, I just say he was 
mentally abusive. People don't understand the impact a real bad 
gaslighting situation has on your mind. I'm 23 and everyday is still a 
struggle.
This is a really good point, gaslighting does have levels. Like, 
telling someone they’re making something up is gaslighting, but a 
different kind than what you went through.
I think the one of the problems that arises from these different 
levels is ppl don’t understand the cutoff and start calling any time 
someone disagrees with them or lies to them gaslighting. Even though it 
can be to different severity’s, gaslighting is a specific form of 
manipulation and I feel like a lot of ppl don’t get that
I am so glad you brought up the levels. I feel like there is small
 scale gaslighting and big picture gaslighting. I was gaslit by a peer 
of mine when I was 14 and 15.  We were "just friends" but I had a huge 
crush on him. He would text these things that made me think he liked me 
back and then claim his brother got a hold of his phone and sent it. Or 
say that he was just testing me. But his favorite thing to do was have a
 whole conversation about starting a relationship and then deny all of 
it the next day. Because I was using my parent's phone, I had to delete 
chats so I never had any evidence. I thought I was going crazy. He 
finally admitted that he said all of those things when I told him that I
 was going to tell my parents everything so they could take me to the 
doctor because I must have been going insane.
I don't think he wanted me to think that I was crazy; I think he 
just liked hurting me and teasing me with having a relationship with 
him. Being gaslit was just a side effect. I feel like that is a 
different level than some of the other more intense gaslighting that 
happens.

[Salty145]: This is exactly what someone gaslighting me would say…
What do you mean? Gas lighting isnt real and youre msking things up 😤 /s
I honestly can’t tell if this response is parody or not.
That’s not an accusation, I’m genuinely asking, because trying to 
take a mental poll of the comments is proving impossible through all the
 sarcasm.

https://www.wellandgood.com/misuse-gaslighting
They made a good point. Gaslighting is often misused as a term to 
describe someone being insistent on their argument. It's extremely true.
I like how the author cites Trump as a reason for the word's rise 
in popularity. Not sure how they would quantify that, exactly, but I'll 
allow it.
"Dr. Stern attributes some of the rise of usage (and misusage) of 
the term gaslighting to former president Donald Trump. In 
2017, journalism professor Ben Yagoda wrote inThe Chronicle of Higher Educationthat
 the word gaslighting had increased in usage as a reaction to Trump's 
behavior, stating the former president had a habitual tendency to, "say 
'X', and then, at some later date, indignantly declare, 'I did not say 
"X". In fact, I would never dream of saying "X".'" By ignoring reality 
and perpetuating his own narrative—despite facts proving otherwise—he 
sought to gaslight the American people to accept his reality as the only
 reality."
At the risk of sounding political, there’s a LOt of gaslighting from conservative and corporate interests.
“There’s no such thing as Climate Change”
“Pot is a Gateway drug”
“The economy under Joe Biden is terrible”
These are all just lies or disagreements. The conservatives are not trying to get you to question your sanity.
They are trying to get you to question your interpretation of reality and the world around you.

[Willing-Book-4188]: It’s the same with the word grooming.
We make it so much more difficult for victims to know they’re 
being gaslit or groomed because we misuse these words so much.
Or ‘trauma’ and ‘traumatic’, which people now seem to use to 
describe an unpleasant or embarrassing situation or a minor, 
non-threatening confrontation.
Public speaking is not ‘traumatic’. Being told off by a teacher 
for handing in your assignment late is not ‘traumatic’. Having a flat 
meeting where your flatmates tell you that you aren’t doing the dishes 
often enough is not ‘traumatic’ (and is usually not ‘gaslighting’ 
either)
I’ve heard adults toss it around wantonly regarding other adults they’ve dated, it’s like a victim complex thing methinks.
I just commented about this. That definitely happened with me. I 
didn’t even know I was being gaslit (and was gas lighting myself) 
because I didn’t know what the term really meant but I sure as heck saw 
it flying around social media a lot.

[MVPPB5]: Everyone is being gas lit. If not actively being gaslit it’s 
because you’re dealing with a narcissist. If you’re not dealing with 
either of those, it’s because you have undiagnosed adhd and autism. If 
you aren’t on the spectrum with adhd it’s because of undiagnosed trauma 
responses.
Self diagnosis has become a way for people to excuse themselves for shitty behavior really.
Not to be 🤓, but PLEASE say “Everyone claims/thinks they’re being
 gaslit”. Without it, you seemed like you were genuine there and thought
 everybody was actually being gaslit, not just calling out the 
victim-complex(your last sentence is the only part that clarified you 
were against the gaslight complex). Have a good day!

[[deleted]]: What you need to realize is that no one takes people who use “gaslighting”, “narcissist”, etc lightly seriously.
It draws attention the first time, but once they develop a pattern
 of consistently throwing the words around regarding 90% of 
relationships they have / anyone they disagree with…
People quickly realize it’s projection. Why does this one 
individual seem to have a new friendship/relationship falling out once 
per year? Why are they always the only one publicly talking sh*t while 
other(s) high-road it?
Those people either eventually grow up or don’t wind up well off 
in the long run lol. Everyone has seen this scenario play itself out.
That said, the title of the post is ironic — because the reason such behavior is problematic is that thereareplenty of people who actually get subjected to this sort of abuse.
That’s exactly why the terms shouldn’t be diluted or used lightly.
It also becomes a problem if you start accusing people of gaslighting when all they're doing is arguing with insistance.

[RemarkableOil8]: Good post. Now do the same thing for narcissism.
[quinnrem]: The distinction between an argument and gaslighting is crucial. 
Disagreements are normal. People will naturally use persuasive rhetoric 
when trying to argue a point. “I didn’t say that, I said this,” or, “you
 said this, and I’m going to refute it by telling you this,” is an 
ARGUMENT. Sometimes arguments are heated and people say rude or unkind 
things. But it does not entail gaslighting.
[TwoMuddfish]: Thank you sir, glad someone could put this so eloquently . Kudos!
[Washtali]: Anyone saying you are gaslighting is literally proving your point lol
[Michaelean]: And everyone is a narcissist these days
[Ninja333pirate]: Its just like people saying "omg I'm so OCD" when they just like 
their space tidy and organized. Or if someone is shitty to someone that 
person is always called a narcissist. Mental health terms always have 
been used in ways they are not ment to be by people who dont know what 
they mean and make assumptions about them.
[hintersly]: I used to get annoyed when my ex would say I was gaslighting him whenever I would tell him I was upset.
First of all - if anything this is closer to emotional manipulation
Second of all- it’s also not emotional manipulation because I’m just sharing my feelings
[reputction]: It’s people with little real world experience who call everything gaslighting online.
[cheyennedraws]: Someone tell this to my fucking mother. She tells me I'm 
gaslighting amd manipulating her all the time when I disagree with her.
Then she proceeds to constantly call me crazy and say I need help 
for not correctly remembering things that supposedly did or did not 
happen, always conveniently in her favor.

Why tf do people try to act apathetic, like they think they're 
superior for "not being phased by things". I've seen in discussions 
where people want to talk about issues in their country and people call 
you a pussy for caring and they make sure that everyone knows that they 
don't care thinking they look like a badass, it's all just for 
attention. An actual apathetic person wouldn't be assed to be part of 
the conversation nor care how people perceive them.  So where does this 
idea stem from.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[General-Sky-9142]: It's to give a false sense of competency. It protects them from seeming vulnerable from their perspective.
[Zawaya]: As someone who is pretty apathetic, I think you're confusing being apathetic with being a narcissistic prick.
[One_Willingness_91]: i think dissociation and nihilism are fairly common, as it’s a 
more stress-free way of viewing the world. neurodivergence is more 
prevalent with newer generations, and this is largely due to 
technological innovation.
while i’m sure there are those cringy, badass, normies, who just 
copy people who actually have socially debilitating coping mechanisms, i
 think a lot of people from gen z prefer to have authentic interactions 
where you are cordial, but don’t overextend yourself in trying to be 
nice. it’s just a waste of energy at the end of the day, and it’s cringe
 behavior.

I've posted this elsewhere but I'm curious about what you guys think.
I think the 2030's and the culture of early Gen Alpha will be a 
sobering and restrained time for youth culture. The ethos of constant 
consumption, overstimulation, and perfectly curated identities will 
become unappealing to them, resulting in the adoption of an ascetic 
attitude and a moralistic outlook on their media/material intake. This 
will likely take the form of left-leaning ideology as a reaction against
 the functional libertarianism of the youth culture before them and the 
progressing excess of US culture.
Archetypes like cinephiles, music people, the 'terminally online',
 'girlies', bro/fitness dudes, and other cultural categories based on 
consumption and marketable aesthetics will become rejected as 
manifestations of oedipal narcissism and decadence. There will be a 
reckoning among the people who made the culture of the 2020's a core 
part of their personality. Most will quietly drop their old obsessions 
and look back on the past decade with embarrassment. There will be some 
who cling on to old ideas and old narratives, though. Holdovers from 
these groups will become the nucleus for a new reactionary 
libertarianism, in the same way that holdovers of 2000's bros, 
edgelords, and gamers/nerds kickstarted the 2010's wave of reaction when
 societal changes became too disagreeable to their behavior, morals, 
consumption habits, etc. Nerds and fandom types will be reviled for 
centering their identities on products and will be considered the 
forerunner of every obsessive cinephile, music guy, etc.
Anti-intellectualism will go out of style when these more 
level-headed Gen Alpha's make reasoned discourse a core signifier of 
their cohort, as against Gen Z's obsession with insult-as-argument and 
'ironic' adulation of the moronic and vaguely funny. Attempts at 
compassion and understanding will replace our sneering cultural elitism.
 Activism will be in-vogue again, this time with more revolutionary and 
targeted aims. The culture of the 2030's will still be a product of its 
time, however. Much like Millenial culture of the 2010's they will still
 be consumers, albeit with the pretense of 'ethics'. Their 
intellectuality will be a status signal rather than genuine 
understanding and self-reflection. Their sense of morality will be used 
more as a bludgeon against the out-group rather than a guide for their 
own action. Their political commitments will ultimately be shallow and 
wither away when confronted with the possibility of giving up certain 
first-world comforts for the sake of praxis. The generation a decade or 
two after them will accuse Gen Alpha of being resentful of the cultural 
capital of their predecessors and will once again make materialism the 
core of their identity.
There is hope, though. We live in an era of excess and hopefully 
the next decade will see an ethical and pragmatic reckoning, one that 
will hopefully stick and make substantive positive change in the world.

some strawman for people I dislike but a prediction of how I and others

subculture (that I still have an attachment to) which is entering a 
period of decadence and reevaluation.
Have you been on reddit? Literally that is 90% of the posts 
politically speaking, and it even goes on nonpolitical subreddits
[EgoSumQuidSum]: This post is more of a sober self-reflection of myself and my 
peers. I was pretty online a few years before and after covid and that 
experience shaped my tastes and attitudes profoundly. Only in the past 
couple years am I now looking back and realizing how shallow and 
irresponsible that culture was and still is. The embarrassed person who 
reluctantly moves on with the times (or at any rate, grows up) isn't 
some strawman for people I dislike but a prediction of how I and others 
like me will act in the next five years or so. This is an epitaph for a 
subculture (that I still have an attachment to) which is entering a 
period of decadence and reevaluation.

TÍTULO: This time will be different : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
To those who say he didn’t undermine democracy last time, I’m 
heartbroken and genuinely afraid. This time, he controls all branches of
 government, and the systems that previously restrained him are no 
longer in place.
While he may have failed to fully dismantle democracy before, he 
inflicted significant damage and undoubtedly tried. He’s learned from 
that experience and removed those around him who put country and duty 
before loyalty to him.
Now, he is emboldened as never before, surrounded by sycophants 
and loyalists—not loyal to the nation or the Constitution, as some were 
last time, but solely to him.
People will die because of our collective choice. People already 
have died as a result of 2016. Rights will be lost. Our freedoms of 
religion, speech, and more are under grave threat. Our rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are in jeopardy. E Pluribus Unum 
feels further out of reach than ever. This new America is being shaped 
for Christians—heteronormative, straight Christians—of which I am none.
This America has chosen to actively assault my right to exist as I
 am. I now know that many of my neighbors and even some in my own family
 don’t believe I deserve the same rights to public life as they do.
I wish the god you profess to believe in was real, because that 
god, as you describe him, would surely despise what you now represent.
The United States has become a "Christian" nation with the least 
Christ-like values imaginable. How twisted and corrupt we’ve become. As 
the harm caused by these policies unfolds, both here and around the 
world, I hope you find the strength to reflect on your choice and come 
to terms with the consequences.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[tinypolski]: You forgot about his handling of the arrival of covid.  He's also 
likely not going to care very much about what happens in 2028 - by then 
he will have set up his family and loyal supporters with their rewards, 
and he finally got the popular vote so his ego has been stroked now and 
he'll be happy to live out the rest of his life on the golf course and 
give no fucks about what the people that elected him think of him by 
then.
Look, I don’t like Trump either but this argument boggles the fuck out of me
Trump  admin made the vaccine operation warp speed was all him. 
When it was trumps vaccine all skeptical when it was Bidens it was take 
the shot or else
Nah that’s not how it happened.

[NemATolvajkergetok]: Get your shit together, zoomer, and either come to terms with 
reality, or die with your delusions. One of these is bound to happen.
This is reality. The Christian nationists who ignore the teachings
 of christ will soon control all 3 branches of government. This is just 
fact. Open, plain, and simple... and sad... fact.
Are these "Christian nationalists" in the room with us now? You're
 projecting. You're acting scared of "Christian nationalists" because 
you were indoctrinated into hating these two things. You're no different
 from those who fear a Jewish homosexual takeover.
They are listed in Trumps stated cabinet selection. So yes, they are metaphorically in the room with us now.
So who would they be? And why is it a problem for you? Will they 
ban making stupid comments on Reddit, thus making your life pointless?
Yea they literally overturned Roe v Wade and will try to strip 
more rights on a federal basis now that they’ll be able to. It’s not 
remotely the same you fucking idiot.
Just because you’re a male doesn’t mean this doesn’t have 
significant impact for a significant part of the population; they’re 
just getting started. You probably won’t ever be in position to 
responsibly raise kids but if you eventually have a daughter, would you 
want her to have the right to make informed personal decisions about her
 body that are much more complicated than Christian God=good?

relationship. You’re not Shakespeare America just didn’t vote your way 
go lick your wounds and come back better in 2 or 4 years and vote for 
someone new.
I dont think you understand what the total corruption of our 
governing institutions mean for our ability to meaningfully vote in 2 to
 4 years.
Yeah you wake up in 2 years and you go vote for representatives and senators and switch the parties it’s not to hard.
With the government gutted and whole departments correupted, 
defunded, or shut down... with the Supreme Court packed with sycophants 
for the next 2 generations...
Voting will be effectively meaningless. It will take decades to rebuild what is about to be dismantled in 2 years.
Ok bro keep doing your doomer black pill thing while everyone else goes about their lives in the other room.
Keep going about your lives in the other room while people die and
 this nation is sold off to the highest bidder for the benefit of a 
notorious con man.

[Feeling-Currency6212]: Donald Trump won the popular vote. You are in the minority now. Accept that your beliefs are the fringe.
I accept that my position was held by a minority of voters, but that doesnt make what I said any less true.
spoken like a true narcissist.
That's not narcissism, lmao.
"im right, youre wrong" - textbook narcissism.
That's literally not narcisism. Narcisism is excessive self-love 
and vanity where one prioritizes their own needs above the needs of 
anyone or anything else.
Nothing about having strong convictions is narcissistic. Quite the
 oposite actually. Narcissists tend to have weak convictions and will 
take what ever position advantages them the most. My position here 
advantages me in no way.
The insult that you could attempt to use here is arrogance. But, you know, arrogant people are also, often, right.
Being correct, in this case, is not good.
the fact that you went on that long rant to validate yourself proves your narcissism.
owned him, lol
Some times facts are black and white, I am a narcissicist when I tell someone the earth is round?
2 +2 = 4?
why would the earth being round be the same as a political opinion?  grasping here arent you?
no just the princple of your are a narcissicist so you are wrong, 
(if you want to talk philosophy maybe all 3 of us are narcissitist priks

all i know is my bat shit crazy statment meter has a lot more points in trump then harras

TÍTULO: Thoughts on xenogenders/neopronouns  : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Saw the same post on the gen alpha subreddit while keyword searching, wanted to know what gen z thought of it.
Personally, they're cringe. They serve no practical use at all.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[joetscience]: I'll repeat what I saw on Insta a while ago.
The people who are using these pronouns are those who are likely 
in the middle of an identity crisis and are trying to find a way to 
figure stuff out. It's temporary and a part of life. They're 
early-middle teens, there is plenty of growing for them to do. Pronouns 
aren't dangerous and don't hurt anyone else. Not worth wasting energy to
 worry over something that'll sort itself out.
Most people I've known to use them have stopped using them after a
 while because they're not teens anymore. A few people don't however and
 that's perfectly fine. It's a little "cringe" but harmless and a lot of
 the people that use them use more regularly used pronouns on the side. 
It's something people tend to grow out of but sometimes they decide it 
fits for them and either way if it works for them that's all that 
matters

[Sayoregg]: I'm trans so I'll respect a person's pronouns of course. 
Neopronouns do feel a bit counterproductive at times but it's not a 
pressing problem so whatever.
[unrealvirion]: Doesn’t hurt anyone, so I’m fine with it.
[International-Cup897]: If someone wants me to use that for them and it makes them happy, 
then why wouldn't I? It doesn't affect me in any way except having to 
change a few words.
But it’s kinda selfish to force other people to use impractical 
pronouns though. Like I’m fine with anything up to they/them, but 
anything beyond that like ze/zer or xe/xem is just annoying. Like I’m 
not gonna use those because they don’t make sense.
They aren't forcing you
Then why should I have an incentive to use their pronouns?
arent you a boyscout, do you need reason to respect and honor the requests(or identity) of your fellow?
I would if it was he/she/they, but anything beyond that, no.
interesting, you know, when i was your age (not long ago) they was not on the table in the same way,
so thats cool
For the sake of politeness? Being respectful? If somebody tells 
you what their name is, what incentive do you have to call them by that 
name?? It's the same principle. If they're being nice about it, who 
cares if it's something ridiculous?
But it’s just cringe tho
People have names, don’t they? You force people to use your name

For the sake of politeness? Being respectful? If somebody tells 
you what their name is, what incentive do you have to call them by that 
name?? It's the same principle. If they're being nice about it, who 
cares if it's something ridiculous?
But it’s just cringe tho
People have names, don’t they? You force people to use your name
[Loud-Union2553]: They aren't forcing you
Then why should I have an incentive to use their pronouns?
arent you a boyscout, do you need reason to respect and honor the requests(or identity) of your fellow?
I would if it was he/she/they, but anything beyond that, no.

[[deleted]]: People have names, don’t they? You force people to use your name
[Wyvern9876]: I totally agree.
[IH8REDDITMODERATORS]: It's fucking stupid.
[[deleted]]: Gender is a silly joke and we can make our language whatever we 
want. Neopronouns and xenogenders are punk as hell, as evidenced by the 
fact that they scare and confuse people who are really into our current 
shitty system of arbitrary identity, and liberate people who want to 
feel free from it.
When you make a video game character, sometimes you do wild shit, right? Real life ain't no different.That's freedom.
[danganronpalover]: I feel like it shouldn’t be that hard to just respect a person’s 
gender identity. I really don’t understand why you wouldn’t. There 
aren’t any downsides
Exactly, no skin off my ass
Neopronouns, while wildly impractical, are not as annoying as xenogenders.
It’s not that I don’t respect them as a person. It’s just that I 
don’t want to indulge in their phase that will wear off as they grow 
up.
Xenogenders are only used by teenagers who want to feel unique. If
 someone asks me to call them “cat/catself” I’m sorry, but no, lol. I’m 
not calling you that. I’ll call you they/them if that’s fine, and if not
 that then I’ll just call you whatever you appear as. I am not indulging
 in a childish roleplay that stems from tiktok and discord.
Neo pronouns do not originate from TikTok
Completely agree. If you're going to make a fool of yourself and 
identify as something that isn't human, you do you but I still see you 
as a human and I won't  dehumanize you by referring to you as anything 
but a human.
Not just xenogenders, but even it/its is not valid for humans. 
It/its is for nonhuman animals and inanimate objects, and honestly even 
for nonhuman animals like pets most pet owners refer to their pets with 
gendered pronouns.
Because it’s not about respect, it’s about not being obligated to 
use a certain type of language. I’ve got a friend who went by 
neopronouns for a while. They were super cool, and regardless of their 
pronouns, I respected the hell out of them. I really believe that 
respect goes far beyond just using a certain set of words to describe 
someone, it’s about treating them well in your interactions with them, 
regardless of if you choose to use their pronouns or not. As long as I 
respect that person and they respect me, they have no right to tell me 
what language to use, the same way that I have no right to decide their 
gender identity for them
I'm not going to respect people who call themselves a "xe/xer."
Why tf not, who are you to say what they are or arent
You can call yourself whatever you want, I'm just not going to respect it.
Why? Does it make you feel powerful or smth? Whys a little common decency making you so upset
Because no one is obligated to use any language they do not wish 
to use. I don’t totally agree with the guy you’re arguing with, I think 
whether or not you use someone’s pronouns, you still should respect them
 as a person, but at the end of the day, no one has any right to tell me
 or anybody else what language to use, just as I have no right to tell 
you what your gender identity should be
I just don't like indulging in people's batshit insane delusions.
Is it really a gender identity though?
ok what hold on what is a gender identity? what decides that??
I understand it as the way you present yourself along a spectrum of masculine/feminine behaviors and roles
Because by going along with it you are enabling it and contributing to its normalisation/encouragement.
You can do what you want. I’ll always remain polite. But I do have
 to draw lines somewhere. I can’t go along with anything anyone decides.
What if handicapped people wanted everyone to clarify they aren't 
handicapped ie when you make a restaurant reservation you call and say 
table for 5, were not handicapped so any table will do, as opposed to 
only mentioning this if  you are handicapped and need special 
accomodation. That would be silly right?

she/her and he/him when that's how 99% of people identify.
To me this would be like everyone having to identify they're not 
handicapped when the assumption is you aren't currently. Imagine if when
 you called to make restaurant reservations you said table for 5 and 
were all able and not handicapped. They would be like WTF are  you 
telling me that. You really only need to say something if you need 
accomodations outside of the norm.
[00rgus]: I've never met anyone, online or irl, who uses them so I personally don't care
[Numerous-Sentence950]: I'm sorry, but I don't speak chinese

no, just not Chinese

no, just not Chinese
[Numerous-Sentence950]: no, just not Chinese
[boomboomclang]: 

[tastyplastic10125]: I dont really care. I don't like these discussions though. It's 
just a way to gather and spread negativity. "Btw nobody asked but 
regular reminder that neopronouns suck"
[KaraTCG]: They don't hurt anyone, so I do not care. I will call people 
whatever they ask to be called. I've met literally one person in real 
life that uses them.
It isn't my business to psychoanalyze randos, just to respect them.
But by doing that, you’re encouraging it. I know it may not harm 
anybody, but it makes people take you less seriously in the professional
 environment and to be honest it just makes you slightly annoying. I 
don’t think anybody should be dictating the personal language we 
describe them as.
“It isn't my business to psychoanalyze randos, just to respect them.”
Well, that’s your opinion. But if I’m talking to 
somebody—regardless of if they use neos/are xenogender—and the first 
thing they mention is their pronouns, then they probably aren’t the kind
 of person I want to be talking to anyway.
I've never witnessed a single person in any social situation lead with their pronouns.
But I do agree that if you encounter someone like that and aren't 
capable of respecting them, it would likely be optimal for you to not 
interact with them any further. You probably aren't the sort of person 
they'd want to associate with anyways.
You, for some weird reason, seem to believe that respect is a 
natural occurrence when meeting somebody. No. Respect is earned, not 
given out like candy. A person has to earn my respect before they can 
dictate what I call them.
If I meet someone for the first time, they’re just an 
acquaintance. If they give me some special set of pronouns to use I 
probably just won’t care and will continue to call them by what they 
appear as.
I suspect we have such drastically different views on the world 
and how we relate to the people in it that agreement or even 
understanding is likely impossible in this area.
I think every person I encounter is deserving of my respect 
because they are my fellow human beings. They can do things to lose that
 respect. But they get it initially and part of that respect is 
referring to them in a respectful manner based on their preferences. My 
personal opinions on what they've chosen to go by aren't relevant.
Your words are eloquently spoken. Thank you

Existing as a trans person isn't a "movement", and fighting for trans people's right to exist isn't "attention seeking".
Not calling someone "xeyir" doesn't Thanos-snap them.
I'm not even talking about neopronouns, I'm talking about trans 
people in general, given that the single post on your profile is just 
transphobia that thankfully got removed.

[smokekirb]: I’ll call people whatever even if I think it’s kinda dumb. I’m 
genderqueer and I don’t have a pronoun preference so that’s probably why
 I feel this way. I don’t expect people to call me not she bc I’m so 
feminine.
[[deleted]]: Dude, they’re not real. If they are, I guarantee you’ll never meet
 someone who uses those in real life. Most of those people are 
chronically online. People need to stop getting mad at shit like this, 
you have 80 years left of your life at best
[AyiHutha]: Being a cat is not a sexual orientation or a gender identity.
Exactly 💀
I have yet to see a case of a person "identifying as a cat" that 
wasn't just a conservative panic piece. This is no different than the 
2010s attack helicopter jokes.
So you agree that Xenogenders including Catgenders and variations 
as well as alterhumans are not real sexual identities or genders
I really don't have an opinion on their validity. I just think the conservative panic response to them is asinine.
But you said it was equal to an attack helicopter joke which is an
 explicit disbelief of the idea that gender identity could be an animal.

who might be non-binary, but you don't have to understand something to 
respect it. Doesn't hurt anyone to be nice.
[[deleted]]: I think it is dumb, but if i meet someone that wants me to call them something different I'll probably still do it.
[xXShadowAndrewXx]: Im sorry but i havent watched the movie with the xenomorphs yet, and probably never will
[[deleted]]: I don’t think it’s particularly harmful or anything, but it’s also
 clearly a sign that someone is going through a type of identity crisis.
 I won’t stop you from doing your thing, but I also won’t contribute to 
that person’s identity crisis by using those pronouns. If they want me 
to call them he, she, or they, that’s cool, no problem in that case.
Agreed, and anything else automatically gets lumped in as they/them unless they opt for one of the other two.
They/them is a generic pronoun that applies for everyone, I don't see why anyone should get offended by they/them.

[Greedy_Disaster_3130]: What the hell is a xenogender and a neopronoun
[Inner_Wafer1621]: Honestly, as long as they aren’t using some pronouns that I can’t 
pronounce(which would be pretty hard because I tend to have better 
pronunciation than my peers), then I will abide by their pronouns. It’s 
kind of like with furries. Would I do that? No. But will I be a pain 
because they identify differently? Also no! If it doesn’t seriously 
disrupt or cause harm, then I couldn’t care less. Xenogrnders and 
neopronouns even more so because it’s just how someone wants me to refer
 to them.
[Darth_T0ast]: I have yet to meet anyone who’s attempted to use them in real 
life, I really don’t think they’re real. I also hear a rumor that they 
got started on 4chan to mock actual trans people, so that isn’t cool but
 I have no proof.
[Turbulent_Ad_4926]: don’t care + i think anyone who thinks about it for that long should get a different hobby
re: “forcing me to use weird pronouns” 1. nobody is 
forcibly compelling your speech lol, no more than you’re “forced” to say
 please/thank you or any other social platitude, 2. you can just not. I 
find the whole thing to be exhausting and because i’m a generally 
live-and-let-live guy if somebody says “only refer to me by 
<complicated set of pronouns>” i go “okay” and then I simply do 
not refer to that person at all. 🤷🏻 there’s no world in which youhaveto discuss another individual in the third person. Names exist.
[DisciplinedPenguin]: EDIT: This is a reply to the original unedited comment.
There is no separation between sex and gender. If there was you 
wouldn't be using the same words lmao. If your true intent is to convey 
that you feel that you align with the "social constructs" and behaviors 
typical of the other gender/sex then you would say that, or you could 
call yourself a tomboy/tomgirl (words we already had to describe this 
phenomenon). But no that isn't your intent, you want people to actually 
believe you are a full on different gender/sex than you are, that's why 
you use the words "Man" or "Woman", otherwise you wouldn't use such 
obfuscating terminology.
On top of that people like you will say "Trans women are real 
women!" or vice versa  (which would go against your claim that sex and 
gender are different), and champion mutilating bodies in order to modify
 physical features and make it more convincing that you're the sex which
 you aren't.
[Crooked_Cock]: I legit don’t care it doesn’t effect me in any way whatsoever
[zaxfaea]: Honestly, I'm sick of the conversation. I'm a trans man who uses them, and the conversation basically sums up to:
-They're cringe (aka "anything that doesn't fit within 
cisnormativity is inherently ridiculous! it has nothing to do with my 
active choice to see you this way, I promise!")
-They're frivolous/ only online because people never use them 
outside their personal lives (that's because there's no infrastructure 
to use them outside of personal life, and people are hostile and 
transphobic towards them.)
-They're unneeded (it's fine if you don't have a use for them,  
but you aren't entitled to decide what's needed for every trans 
individual.)
-They're only used by teens so they can be dismissed as a phase (a
 third or more of the community is adults, and I'm an adult myself. But I
 guess it's easier to just stereotype us as childish than stop being 
dismissive, huh.)
Chances are you won't encounter us offline, and online you can 
just block or avoid us. So I wish non-xenogender people would just mind 
their business instead of constantly circlejerking about whether we're 
"valid" or not.
Because they’re not valid, lol.
Validity is for Tumblr teens and people who spend too much time thinking about them lmao. It's afactthat I'm using them to talk about my experience as a transsexual man, 
and if you aren't paying for my transition then it's not your business. 
I'm not harming anyone, and my experience with transition is being 
enriched by it. "Validity" is meaningless. I think you're cringe for 
bringing it up.
[Business_Cheesecake7]: Because they’re not valid, lol.

[[deleted]]: I got plenty of xenogender thots if that don't make me gay I ain't gay
[MomFussy512]: It's interesting to see how language evolves with the introduction of xenogenders and neopronouns.
[du_rel_gug_menl]: They’re annoying confusing and serve no true purpose . If it gets 
to that point I’m just gonna call you by your first name.
[heartthump]: Every trans person I have personally met (and i know this is anecdotal) despises them
[Key-Candle8141]: I cant remember ppl names I'd have big problems if anyone ever asked me to call them some other than what they obv are
[scholalry]: I think we need to get off of social media. If I actually met 
someone who used them, I would probably struggle to use them properly 
but try my best out of respect. However I am not convinced that 
neopronouns actually exist outside of social media. I have never met 
anyone who uses them, and I see them so rarely even on social media. I 
feel like the only place I’ve actually been exposed to them is when 
conservatives are making fun of them online.
I know that’s anecdotal and I am sure there are people who do 
actually use neo pronouns, but I can’t help but feel like the main 
purpose of them is to scare people about the actual gender and sexuality
 issues the LGBTQ+ faces. Not unlike how people will point to a random 
streaker at pride and be like “SEE GAY PEOPLE WANT CHILDREN EXPOSED TO 
NAKED MEN. BAN PRIDE”  because it distracts from all the actual point 
and benefits of pride and turns people against it who don’t actually 
know what pride is about.
[[deleted]]: The silly thing about pronouns to me is were all expected to use 
them even though I've maybe 2 or 3 times in my entire life met someone 
who was something different than I would expect and even when it was a 
non-passable trans woman I would have referred to that person has 
her/she.
To me this is like if evertime I called a restaurant to make a 
reservatio I said table for 5, oh and nobodys disabled so seat us 
anywhere, we can go down stairs, etc. Why would I say that when that's 
pretty much expected if I don't say otherwise.
Basically if you're something that would surprise people go by 
them but everyone else shouldn't have to use pronouns nor should it even
 be such a large discussion
[ShardofGold]: I'm not learning them on my own time because most people I meet more than likely won't be using them.
However if you want me to use certain pronouns for you, I'll try 
my best to, but if you act like an idiot because I slip every now and 
then, I'll stop and won't care what you want me to call you, because at 
that point you're making a mountain out of a mole hill.

[ohshithellno]: It's really not a big deal to me. They seem to just do it online. And they pretty much all grow out of it eventually.
[boomboomclang]: It’s almost the same as if you affirm someone with anorexia by 
saying they’re fat. You’re doing more harm than good by feeding into 
their mental illness. I’ll get downvoted but idc at this point.
[OkNewspaper6271]: call yourself whatever you want im still gonna use she they he or a very small selection of neopronouns
[Th_rowaway22]: It’s strange and new to me. I’m indifferent and have yet to meet a neopronoun user in real life yet.
[Phoenixxx13509]: I don't think they have to serve a practical use, if you are 
thinking about it like that no pronouns really serve a 'practical use'.
It's just how people identify, like their names. Just because it's
 new to you or you don't understand them doesn't means they're bad. Hell
 I have a very science-y friend and I don't understand anything she 
talks about but I still know it's important and respect it. This is not 
much different.
[aronAREUMADLOLcaps]: If you are a man, you are he/him if you are a woman, you are she/her its very simple as it should be
[[deleted]]: Like the majority of this movement, it's just attention seeking.
[des2130]: Y’all are gonna hate this one but I don’t care. If you were born a
 male, you are a male. Vice versa. I do not treat the LGBTQ+ community 
any differently but that doesn’t mean I have to support it. I will get 
downvoted to hell but that’s alright. That’s my opinion.
I mean your opinion is objectively untrue but I'll still respect it.
[ohshithellno]: I mean your opinion is objectively untrue but I'll still respect it.

TÍTULO: What is the biggest problem for us? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
What does everyone think this generation's biggest issue is. It can be Political, Religious, Economic, Social,etc.
My personal issue is that a lot of people do not have concrete morals.I see that a lot of are morally loose.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[heartszxox]: Mine is the fact that everyone is so sensitive about everything.
Yeah out of all the issues in the world the big one is that people
 online are sensitive sometimes lol that's what's doing us in
Yeah talk about 1st world problems, not really though considering 
even the more mundane political talking point problems in 1st world 
countries like inflation and unemployment are more troublesome than 
sensitivity. 😂
Probably want to take that up with your lot because a majority of 
people who complain about "sensitivity" were being cry babies 
themselves.
Never in my life I had ever seen so many "facts don't care about 
your feelings" people lose their crap over books or beer commercial.
Or it’s that they can’t live out their Call of Duty lobby 
discussions IRL. The ones who claim people are “too sensitive” always 
have a predilection towards normalizing offensive human behavior that we
 as a society have agreed is the mark of an asshole.
Yeah, they're basically little shitheads who get mad when people don't take their crap.
I don’t think it’s the biggest issue but I see what you’re saying.
 Things sucked but they always have. Gen z loves to make excuses for 
things
Definitely in the top 3.
I remember sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me. Now everyone is a little bitch.
Yeah, imagine getting so triggered about trans women on beer cans that you go purchase that beer just to destroy the can.

reasonable perspective.
True, ðere are worse þings going on in ðe world, countries litteraly going þouȝ ƿar, genocide, and famine, or poverty

[Helix3501]: The death of empathy and the completion of religious corruption 
seeing religion just becoming nothing but a tool for con men and right 
wing nutjobs to assemble groups of idiots who will never think 
critically
Which one is to blame?
[Choco_Cat777]: Which one is to blame?
[devil652_]: Probably the job market/housing crisis or the male loneliness epidemic.
It's going to be horrible in a few decades but sadly, most 
boomers, millennials, and gen who caused it wont be around to see how 
their actions destroyed everything.
They wont be able to reap what they sow.
Ahem. Millennial had zilch to do with the housing crisis.
There is no male loneliness epidemic, you’re just not as nice of a guy as you think you are.
Oh ok. Wdym there is none though?
It’s an excuse for shitty men to justify being shitty.
How so?
They don’t take into consideration two major things.
Women don’t need men for nearly as many adult essentials anymore. 
Historically, women only got married either for practical reasons, or 
the marriage was arranged. Society has come a long way since then. 
Single women can now be fully functional adults and have everything a 
married woman does.
(More relevant) With the rise of the internet, women (and men) 
have more options for companionship. With more options, the bar 
naturally becomes higher, and that’s a good thing. Shitty men in 
previous generations got away with too much shit and set a bad precedent
 for future generations in terms of how to treat women, expectations of 
their partners, etc. We need to do better, and incels just can’t come to
 terms with that. They think they’re entitled to a free maid that lets 
them stick their dick inside them.
The male loneliness isnt just about romantic relationships, it covers all relationships from social friends to family.
.
2. What on earth are you talking about? Women (mostly above 30) 
now are literally all complaining that they cant find husbands because 
of the toxic anti relationship culture spread from social media. Causing
 women to now also be lonely with some quoting "its not a male 
loneliness epidemic, women are lonely also, it's a general loneliness 
epidemic." Social media has screwed them over.
.
3. The bar becoming higher is not a good thing. It's literally amemewith the ridiculous expectations that you're possibly refering to, that do indeed exist.
Male loneliness epidemic? Or not enough men know how to socialize effectively and think social media is the real world
Male loneliness is completely self inflicted
Well....no
Who’s fault is it
Boomers, gen x, millennials, progressives, big corporations, government, etc
LMAO so everyone but the lonely men. Tell me how all of those 
groups interfere with a man’s ability to talk to women, and why they 
don’t impact all men
Government weakened unions, making it harder for young men to 
achieve financial stability in todays age. With stagnant wages, 
unaffordable housing, education debt, etc.
Boomers and gen x caused a cultural shift favoring individuality 
over community, leading to a trickle of isolated lifestyles. They caused
 a housing crisis
Progressives caused the sexual revolution which has spiraled into 
modern day hookup culture. A disgusting practice that destroys the body 
and soul while downplaying intimacy.
Big tech comoanies created social media to rise in popularity, 
making gen z the most anti social generation in history so far, with gen
 alpha ipad kids predictably going to be worse.
Millenials helped build upon the toxic culture of anti family and anti relationship with the help of media.
It doesnt impact all men much like how soap doesnt kill all germs. Achieving 100% of something is quite difficult.
Literally 0 self accountability happening. The fact that you’re 
blaming the weakening of unions on the inability to talk to women is 
insane. Get off the internet.

[jjuerakhan14]: Dealing with gun violence. No matter where we go there is almost a
 shooting everywhere. At schools, malls, parks. It’s too much!
Yep. And instead of people trying to fix the issues behind it, 
bullying, mental health, poverty, etc. They blame the firearm itself and
 make that into a controversy. The uk has similar problems with knife 
violence. This isn't that hard
I understand people want to ban them because of that, but you’re 
right, it’s not just the weapons, it’s the people handling them in a 
dangerous and unsafe way!
Yes. Firearms are a tool, like a car or machete, and if you don't 
give it the respect it deserves, people can easily get hurt.
Though they are a lot of arguments against firearms that doesn't 
make sense, such as being against "military grade firearms" because that
 genuinely doesn't mean what a lot of people think. Generally speaking, 
"military grade" only means it was made under certain qualifications by 
the lowest bidder.
Also, for most of the history of firearms, militaries had either 
muskets or single shot bolt action rifles. Yes, the battle at the 
beginning of the 1999 movie, the Mummy, was historically accurate.
That's why I always carry. Too many crazy people these days.
[Artifact-hunter1]: Yep. And instead of people trying to fix the issues behind it, 
bullying, mental health, poverty, etc. They blame the firearm itself and
 make that into a controversy. The uk has similar problems with knife 
violence. This isn't that hard

[luckytheresafamilygu]: Keynesism
[Massive_Cupcake_577]: everyone's too quick to count disagreements as worthy of giving up
 on being kind or even being there, it's not called being a push over, 
it's called not being a jerk. I'm not leaving till you tell me to.
[OrthodoxJuul]: Having low-grade literacy and poor attention spans.
[DistillateMedia]: The corruption of our governments.
Money in politics.
Foreign influence.
Our government no longer serves the people.
It's a legitimate crisis.
The rich only want money power and control.
They don't want actual progress.
They don't want peace.
They don't want to manage climate change.
We are well past justified revolution territory.
Please come to the big party.
April 27th-??? DC/Everywhere.
We must fix this shit, and we can.
And all we have to do is party.
I swear.
Edit:
We can't solve any problems till we deal with this.
Every branch is compromised.
The electoral process itself is a rigged shitshow.
Even the way it's "legally" set up is terrible.
It favors the monied candidates by far.
Campaign finance and a complete restructuring needed.
Edit 2:
They're telling us we'll own nothing and be happy.
That is bullshit and we need to make sure they know it.
[MAst3r0fPupp37s]: Economic of course. Our grandparents were able to buy a house for 
two chickens and 20 dollars. We're paying 2k a month to rent a shifty 
apartment in the city.
[WarriorPoet555]: That we don’t stick together.
Welcome to humanity. The only species dumb enough to separate 
everyone on sex, religion, skin color, or anything else you can think of

[Artifact-hunter1]: Welcome to humanity. The only species dumb enough to separate

[LouisianaLorry]: Individualism along with consumerism. Everyone feels like they're 
alone. There's still this idea that the American dream is complete 
self-reliance. Atheism is on the rise, communities seem to be shrinking.
 Gen Z often sees having an opinion or interest in anything as cringe, 
but then will often struggle to identify who they themselves are outside
 of social media. The local music venues I go to that are free (with 
local musicians my age, making new music) are basically dead, but when 
Taylor Swift came in town, tickets were $500 and all my broke friends 
could somehow afford it.
Addiction. Social media is our new cigarrette, except worse 
because having a smart phone is, at least for me, required these days 
(2FA to log into accounts, need it to get into my building, to log into 
my work computer, everything has an app that wants to track your data). I
 had to take very intentional action to reclaim my own time. Some of my 
coworkers will scroll half the day and get nothing done without help.
Antisocial. I went on a solo trip recently and found that I was 
easily able to talk to anyone over 28. Meanwhile, people closer to my 
age were not open to any form of conversation.
Political. Our oligarchs today are MUCH more infringent on 
citizens rights than ever. Our leaders want an AI surveillance system 
that can monitor you everywhere, and also to abuse that and imprison 
people for "pre-crime"
And I don't even have to bring up economics, I feel like we all 
acutely aware we are watching the end of the golden age of America / the
 West.
Sources: Myself, my gen Z coworkers, my friends, the people I 
talked to at my five-year high school reunion (I went to a private all 
men school and even still 75% of them still live with parents making 
poverty wages), the 10 women I dated this year that had zero personality
[Outside_Bowler8148]: How is it your personal issue that people in your life do not have ‘concrete morals’?
Because they are easy to manipulate
How is that your concern at all? Young ppl by definition are easy to manipulate
[Opposite_Election_87]: Because they are easy to manipulate
How is that your concern at all? Young ppl by definition are easy to manipulate
[Outside_Bowler8148]: How is that your concern at all? Young ppl by definition are easy to manipulate
[MmNicecream]: Climate change is kinda an existential threat, so there's that. 
Also, the increasing concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a
 small number of sociopaths, at the expense of everyone else.
[BigChungusCumslut]: A big problem IMO is highlighted by this post: we are focused with
 what’s the biggest problem with our generation as a collective, and not
 what our own individual biggest problems are. Some of us will struggle 
with finances, others with confidence, others with religion, others with
 meaning/purpose, we each have our own sets of problems that when looked
 at close enough are uniquely ours.
[Violent-Obama44]: Gen Z is horrible at media & art. They have an unaware snobby 
mindset. Everything is considered cringe to them. They can’t create good
 art (music or film) and can’t properly consume art without being hyper 
nihilistic.
Insanely miserable generation.
[Professional_Self296]: People being genuinely unsubjective or non-pragmatic. A lot of 
people don’t seem to frame issues and are treating everything they don’t
 like as a front on their existence. In turn they then make all their 
stances a front on other people’s existence in retaliation. So now you 
have a cycle of people vindictively trying to destroy everyone else’s 
livelihood for their own feelings. Life is not that bad and if we had 
some nuance and middle ground we may actually agree on some things.
[No_Discount_6028]: The biggest problem affecting us is inevitably going to be global 
warming. There are lots of bad things going on right no but everything 
else pales in comparison to the global food system collapsing. 
Mechanized agriculture & supply chains are one of those things that 
has completely transformed life over the course of the past century, to a
 point where most members of the developed world take it for granted and
 have zero frame of reference for how bad things can get.
[thomasrat1]: I’d say a lack of trust/hope in society. Even if our government 
started taking care of its issues, our generation won’t believe it for a
 long time.
[Frewdy1]: Climate change.
[Commissar_Elmo]: That we are rapidly approaching the end of this great period of 
relative peace and democracy after world war 2. The generations that 
made those mistakes are gone now, and we are making the same mistakes.
[Advanced_Plan_4714]: Second the morals. Lack of empty is huge. Also lack of critical 
thinking skills, especially as technology - namely AI - progresses. I 
honestly think we have more hope though than following gens, especially 
seen in elder Gen Z, having grown up before/as smart phones and iPads  
emerged. We played with toys as kids. For some of younger Gen Z it was 
more based in tech, as is Gen A. Fundamentally that’s bad for 
development and will be seen in ways that research isn’t fully showing 
yet  since it’s so new of a thing. But there’s enough to show it’s bad 
for focus and critical thinking and moral development even. Think about 
it, playing with dolls, playing house, playing with car toys; whatever. 
You make up stories. Imagine yourself as someone else. Create something.
 iPads have the stories for you to watch or facilitate them greatly. 
Doesn’t help that culture is now giving platforms for some pretty 
horrible people who show empathy as weakness, especially towards men. I 
have to hope Gen Z has it in them to improve from this developmental 
difference.
[Careful_Response4694]: no gf 😭
[Effective-Quit-8319]: Narcissism and general lack of focus/ attention span.
[greatvinedrake]: Lobbying
lobbying and interest groups have done irreparable damage to the United States, and many other countries
[EmperrorNombrero]: That physical aging is a thing while our entire society (and even a
 bit of our biology) is built around  contest between guys for mates. 
It's  just so incongruent. If you're not born into an insanely great 
starting position, you have little to no chance to be attractive 
looking, chatismatic, and rich once you reach your most desireable age 
at around 25 or so.
Now I'm 28 and losing my hair. Wherre tf is the motivation to do 
ANYTHING gonna come from if the people I'm jealous of are random 23 year
 olds with a trustfund and a social media presence who look like models,
 travel the world and get baddies everywhere they go. The future is just
 entirely bleak. Even if things go insanely well from here on forward, I
 will be old.
And by 30, it's basically over for everyone who isn't  a literall 
top-tier celebrity. Most girls 20-25 will already filter you out based 
on your age alone.
And by 40, it's over career wise as well. If you haven't achieved 
anything at that age, who tf will even respect you or consider you for 
positions that aren't completely awful no matter your qualifications
And by 50 your health is basically fucked in other avenues besides
 your looks and daring potential as well for most people. You will have 
pains, aches, be sick constantly etc.
And then to think that some people have to go on living till 100..
It's hell. This life is hell if we don't figure out how to rewrite our biology
Right  now life is basically just ever growing despair or insane 
levels of coping that will make you lose all contact with reality and 
turn you into a docile little worker bee who is jot allowed to even try 
to take control of their existence
[Choco_Cat777]: I can't say slurs anymore
[SnooWoofers9302]: Every Gen Z ik is a radical these days or are just ignorant in politics, whether it’s the left or right.
[According-Teach-9600]: Lack of spirituality.
[Jstufool]: LGBTQ and also Feminism
How are those people, problems? I was taught to treat everyone 
with kindness and respect and it's been good advice past my 21 years 
alive. Tbh, if more people did the same, we will have world peace.
Cause they go against my culture. I"m fine with people being 
LGBTQ, but they should keep it to themselves, and stay away from us.
Also I'm not against female rights, I"m against "equity" which is pretty much DEI which gives them unfair advantages.
I was taught to treat everyone with kindness and respect
Not us. We are raised insular, and how we treat people doesn't 
matter, only how we're perceived by others. We aren't outright hostile 
to LGBTQ people outside or ethnicity/family, but if someone was LGBTQ in
 our family, they'd get immeditealy disowned.
LGBTQ has the potential to break our family/culture, so I want it curtailed.
Boy, do you hear yourself when you talk? I'm from rural Appalachia
 and grew up in the Baptist church. To some, gay and inter racial 
marriage is an attack on our culture. Yet it would be insane if I 
dislike someone because who they love is a different skin color than 
them and crazier if I disowned my own brother for falling in love with a
 different race woman. The same also goes for lgbt people.
Why are you against women having EQUAL  rights? They are our 
equals. And personally, I want a a driven and independent woman as an 
equal, rather than some type a child or maid. Woman are also a pillar of
 our species. After all, our mothers gave birth to us and are the reason
 we exist, so they deserve respect and everything as a default.
What ever happened to blood is thicker than water? What 2 
consenting adults are doing on their own time has no effect on us.

[[deleted]]: Warranted distrust with older generations
Comment deleted by user
A lot of us have strong feelings against older generations, and to
 me it is warranted. They want us to pick up our bootstraps, but we 
don’t have any, and we don’t have a way to afford them. It’s easy for 
them to say “just save” when it’s not that easy. College is expected, 
Grandchildren are expected, and we simply cannot do it.

[[deleted]]: Very hard-working. Loyal. No limits on anything.
Then there's the complete opposite as well. But most people in my 
social circle are loyal hard-workers. I also think the younger end of 
our generation are currently going through some major changes within 
themselves, which will cause personality development. We are right in 
front of the door that leads us to heaven, but we have to open the door.
After that, we'll really see how we are as people.
[DannyTheGinger]: Depression but also along with that openess about our mental health
[[deleted]]: A sense of distrust of institutions and existing ideas, and a willingness to try new ways of organising society.

I feel our generation doesn’t know how to differentiate serious from joke nor regulate our emotions well.
I’ve seen too many guys and girls think serious things are a joke 
and completely lack empathy for people suffering in some way or the 
other.
On the other hand, you have people who are too easily offended and simply cannot take criticism.

Mm, I think younger people calling people who really aren't old 
"old" is sort of a time-honored tradition. If they're genuinely being 
nasty about it, yes, but if they just tease you about being "old" a lot 
of them are probably being playful about it/not serious. Except for like
 children, they are possibly serious but that's because they don't 
really have a good grasp on the concept of age yet lol
unc thinks hes young LOL

place for humour. Not everything needs to be turned into a meme.
The political apathy.
The lack of patience. It’s good to be able to sacrifice short-term
 gratification for a long-term reward. And it’s a skill you should be

[Phaustiantheodicy]: Agesit, a social and hostile to people who are extroverted, and probably awkwardst people ever
[Tea_Time9665]: This is true of almost every generation but.  Every generation 
thinks they invested the wheel.  They think they invented rebellion. 
That they are the revolutionaries.  That they discovered the “truth”
[squarels]: Doomerism and blaming their failures on society. No long term 
future planning just emotional responses to the event of the week. Takes
 either nothing seriously or everything too seriously.
“Blaming their failures on society” is a completely rational 
perception for them to have because it’s reality. The majority of gen z 
is f*cked long term in everything from employment, financial issues, 
never truly owning anything and worst of all the cultural change when it
 comes to relationships. Most of us are cooked and it’s okay to talk 
about it.
Do you think any other generation was born with no issues to work 
through? Compared to war and famine these are petty minor issues. Like 
really, you want to emphasize relationships as a pressing concern? It’s 
easier than ever to find a girlfriend if you put in a minimum effort.
i can tell your either a boomer or gen x. you have no idea what 
it’s like growing up with social media and the constant stress we have 
in our lives. boomers could leave school at 14 with no qualifications 
and get a job. we need to be a genius just to get an unpaid 
apprenticeship somewhere.
I’m also a zoomer. I was around when Facebook starting getting big
 in middle school. Just never really cared for social media comparison 
and instead got a good degree and a cushy job. Met my gf while traveling
 and just kept stacking. It’s not hard

[[deleted]]: It’s not everyone but there are some of my friends even ones who 
are 30 constantly on their phone when we’re hanging out. Like we will be
 at dinner and I’ll look around to 6 of my friends with their phone in 
their hands
[AlienBogeys]: Hypervigilance due to being chronically online. Example: 
immediately thinking a nuanced but innocent interaction is creepy.
Actually, not being able to understand nuance at all and refusing to learn out of stubbornness.
[CremeSubject7594]: 2 day age gaps being frowned upon
[green-fae]: our gen is definitely too sensitive. and if it's nottheiropinion then its a stupid opinion.
[TrashMorphine]: Those who are narrow-minded and can't think for themself
[Year_Heavy]: I don’t think there are such things as ‘generational traits.’ Each
 person is unique, and traits depend more on upbringing, country of 
origin, education, and environment. There aren’t specific traits that 
apply to an entire generation.
Yes there is. Ask a majority of Gen X if they care and you’ll most
 likely get the same answer. Whatever. We’re shaped by our place in time
 in this world, and while not definitive it leaves a mark 
distinguishable from others.
[EveningRequirement27]: Yes there is. Ask a majority of Gen X if they care and you’ll most
 likely get the same answer. Whatever. We’re shaped by our place in time
 in this world, and while not definitive it leaves a mark 
distinguishable from others.
[GuiltyFigure6402]: Less socialising with new people, less open to making new 
connections, no one cares about improving their social skills and 
talking to new people is too hard/uncomfortable. It's like we all want 
to make friends but no one is willing to make the first move and put 
themselves out there anymore. There is a shortage of extroverted people 
in gen Z. I am not perfect either btw but I try every now and again to 
talk to new people
[Collector-Troop]: I hate how a mass group of us are such trend npc. I swear everyone
 always copy’s each other. Guys be hoping on the gym bandwagon grow a 
mustache, mullet, go thrifting, watch anime and play video games. Are we
 all just living the same life. Girls hop on trends too Stanley cups, 
labubu and Sonny angle.
[Death2Billionaries]: Everything everyone is saying about this generation can be applied
 to all generations lol things never change. My parents have 0 emotional
 control or understanding.
[channamasala_man]: There’s a lot of cry bullies in our generation. People who 
demonstrate almost no empathy for others, but if you say anything to 
them they’ll start playing victim immediately.
[Additional-Yak-1914]: Groupthink
[Nova17Delta]: So aside from the not being able to tell what's a joke or not 
(seriously i shouldnt have to use the damn /s every single time im 
deadpan saying something ridiculous)
I see a lot of people aged 20-25 doing mental gymnastics to avoid 
getting a license or in some cases even doing simple adult tasks.
Not to say I'm innocent of this myself but like
I once argued with one of my Australian friends who came up with 
literally every single excuse under the sun as they could as to why they
 didn't vote in the big election there which, by the way, ismandatory.As in, you'll get fined if you don't vote.
“/s” is a tone indicator for people who can’t get social cues like
 people with autism it isn’t their fault they can’t tell what’s a joke 
or not and no one is forcing you to use “/s” either.
[abandonhuman]: “/s” is a tone indicator for people who can’t get social cues like
 people with autism it isn’t their fault they can’t tell what’s a joke 
or not and no one is forcing you to use “/s” either.
[PeculiarExcuse]: Looks through commentsBasically everything people mention are found in every single generation
Y'all I think a lot of people just suck and it didn't begin or end
 with our generation. I think a lot of people here fell for propaganda; 
every generation has complaints about most of these things for the 
generations younger than them. If any of these issues are worse in gen z
 than previous generations, well, it certainly did not come from 
nowhere. These traits have been passed down to us by older generations 
(our parents, grandparents, etc)
[Tyenotss]: Narcissism.
[[deleted]]: Addiction
[GdayNachos]: I don’t know if this has been in other generations but there is a 
real culture of “the things I like is better than the things you like”. 
Everyone is obsessed with what people wear, what people’s 
hobbies/interests are, who they choose to hang out with, what they put 
on their social media etc. Like who cares, we gotta focus on what makes 
us similar instead of different
[ThatSmartIdiot]: lack of empathy
[cocovenomnomnom95]: Everyone forms cliques even though they are no longer in high school
[Intrxvert_ed]: EXTREMELY short attention spans.
Our generation (specifically the younger half) grew up on TikTok 
and it’s absolutely derailed our attention spans. We’re so used to 
seeing everything that is important in the span of a 30 second TikTok 
video and it’s created this precedent of instant gratification. If it 
doesn’t happen in the span of a few minutes, we want nothing to do with 
it or lose interest and move on to something else.
Prime example- I recently was showing a group of my younger 
friends how to fix things on my car. I needed to replace an alternator 
and (attempted to) show them how to do that, as well as show them around
 the engine bay and a few key components, what they do, how they fail, 
and how you would fix them.
We got like 10 minutes into it and they realized that real life 
doesn’t work like TikTok and it doesn’t magically get fixed in 30 
seconds. They all lost interest and started talking about other things 
while I worked on my car. Only one of them who had a mild interest in 
mechanic work actually decided to stick with it and help.
I’m very glad I haven’t fallen into this trend of instant gratification.
[torthBrain]: The lack of sincerity, abandonment of nuance, 
anti-intellectualism, and rudeness/entitlement as a default are the 
things I hate the most about GenZ I think.
[boringfantasy]: Being performative and quantifying everything.
It’s not just “I read books” anymore it’s “I read 1000 books in a year”
[anaveragephase]: The need to record everything.
[trapezoid-]: Agree
[Winter-Garden-7066]: Recording ppl weather it’s positive or not
[lbug02]: Playing sounds (videos or music) out loud when in a public space
[Throwawayforsure5678]: The majority of Gen z (talking to you later ones) are boring as 
hell and don’t know how to have fun at the club. If you’re gonna just 
stand around and judge people for having a good time and lord forbid 
putting their hands in the air, then don’t come.
[GuavaShaper]: I think that if you have to explain that your joke is a joke to someone, then your joke isn't very funny.

POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk

COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[KeamyMakesGoodEggs]: I wonder how many members of the "prefrontal lobe development" crowd support raising the voting age.
If yall Americans did, there wouldn't be anymore political discourse on the media(reddit and twitter)
Yes there absolutely would.
Keep in mind the reason the voting age became 18 in the first 
place was because that's the age you could be drafted and sent to war.
There were enough protests and enough social outcry that 18 year 
olds could be sent to fight and die for their country, by politicians 
that they couldn't even vote for that they lowered the voting age to 18
Yet cannot be old enough to smoke pot or order a beer seems kinda screwed up to me
You can vote to change that though
I mean they have to put it on a ballot. There's a lot of things we
 could do, but until voters change what they're doing we get the 
Congress that votes unanimously to end time change, and then argues 
along party lines about keeping DST vs standard.
Vote for people who would put that up for a bill.
CA voted to legalize weed in the 90s and the governor overturned 
it. Many states including Utah have voted to expand Medicare and had it 
overturned immediately. Voting doesn’t change much, they just want you 
to think this is a democracy.
It amazes me that Americans can't see that America is basically a pyramid scheme of a country.
Ohh truee😧
There'd be political discourse so long as the age to vote is low 
enough that people are alive to vote. This is universally true, so long 
as there's 2 people there will be at least 2 ideas.
Discourse just means discussion. You don’t think people would talk about politics anymore? That’s so dumb
I wonder if they realize that the prefrontal lobe grows slowly and
 should be “fully developed” around 25-ish. This does not mean people 
that are 24 or 23 are incapable of making good decisions. Like the 
difference in decision making between a 12 year old and 24 year old is 
vast, but not between 23 and 25. Shit the decision making process 
between a 25 year old and 50 year old would probably be vast too.
It is a myth that the prefrontal lobe finishes development at 25! 
The original author of that study capped the age of participants at 25 
and studied no one older. Modern evidence points to constant and 
consistent development of the prefrontal lobe!
Oh I totally forgot about this! Thank you for the information!
"Trust science" they said... While also forgetting science is a 
flawed, ever evolving string of theories and hypothesis that take time. 
lol
They just don't wanna accept any responsibility for themselves.
Or knows what a "prefrontal lobe" is, how it develops and what the consequences of the various stages of development is.
It is a claim that's never supported by an adult understanding of the subject.
The whole argument can only work for the most extreme of things 
(permanent body surgeries/changes) but for the most part society agrees 
young adults can consent to sex, alcohol and driving, even tattoos are a
 little on the young side but yeah. There is an obsession with thinking 
that everything needs to be higher just because. And it’s ridiculous
I wonder how many of the people who want to raise the voting age 
subscribe to a political ideology that has often had trouble getting the
 youth vote.
You mean all of them?
If you can join the army at 18, you should be able to vote (and 
drink and buy tobacco) at 18. If you can’t do all of those “special 
privilege” things, then all the responsibilities should be delayed as 
well.
I don’t care which way, but I personally really hate and find it 
to be deeply hypocritical that people can die for this country before 
they can have a beer in it. It’s messed up.
Not only voting age,all capacities and duties according to Law
You're 24 and you think you're a kid? Sorry, you can't drive then.
 Nor work, buy and sell property without parental consent, open a Bank 
Account, and so on. You're a child after all, right?
Genuinely, where the hell did this shit come from? I didn't see 
myself as a kid in my late teens, let alone at fucking 20 something. 
It's like people deliberately infantilize themselves these days
And wait until they learn the brain continues developing long after 25

[bostonnickelminter]: And wait until they learn the brain continues developing long after 25
[Inevitable_Junket794]: I think 21 is the new 18 in people's minds
25*. Everyone thinks turning 25 will magically turn you into some elder that knows everything about life.
Ironically, they also are the first to say "did you think your 
brain magically develops the night of your 18th birthday? No, at 18, 
you're still just a baybeeeeeeee!"
But apparently it DOES fully cook on your 25th birthday, wow - who knew?
Which is not even correct, because the majority of the frontal 
cortex develops from 23 to 26 and is fully done at around 30.
It varies for everyone and the study ran out of funding and 
stopped studying people at 25. The medical community seems to concur 
that most people are different, and that certain conditions may slow it 
down or speed it up.
In any way it is undisputable that some people are more mature at 
21 than others are at 40. Not all of this has to do with frontal cortex.
Of course.
Yeah, shit, I'm more mature than my dad and I'm half his age!
Actually... physiologically speaking the brain never stops developing
Americans just love to gatekeep sex it use to include bi racial 
couple and the gays. That’s no longer socially acceptable. They’ve got 
one group left.
They have always cared about who’s doing what behind closed doors - to a CREEPY extent.
Shit I mean there's bones in your body (sternum I think but don't quote me) that don't reach adulthood until 40 years old

34 is still young. A lot of people have their first child at 34 and go on to have 3-4 kids

Yeah, shit, I'm more mature than my dad and I'm half his age!
Actually... physiologically speaking the brain never stops developing
Americans just love to gatekeep sex it use to include bi racial 
couple and the gays. That’s no longer socially acceptable. They’ve got 
one group left.
They have always cared about who’s doing what behind closed doors - to a CREEPY extent.
Shit I mean there's bones in your body (sternum I think but don't quote me) that don't reach adulthood until 40 years old
Your stomach starts dying in your thirties.
not me im built different
[Throwawayamanager]: It varies for everyone and the study ran out of funding and 
stopped studying people at 25. The medical community seems to concur 
that most people are different, and that certain conditions may slow it 
down or speed it up.
In any way it is undisputable that some people are more mature at 
21 than others are at 40. Not all of this has to do with frontal cortex.
Of course.

[ship_write]: The whole prefrontal lobe thing is a total myth based on a 
misinterpretation of scientific studies of the brain.  Your entire brain
 continues to change and “develop” over your whole lifespan.  It’s never
 “done.”  There’s no magic “you’re an adult now” number other than the 
level of perceived maturity society generally agrees on.  18 is just 
fine in that regard.  We need to stop treating 20 year olds as if they 
aren’t done cooking yet.
This. Am a brain doctor - the “your prefrontal cortex doesn’t 
fully develop until age 25” is the new “you only use 10% of your brain”
It's really depressing that I've heard intelligent, well-educated 
professionals say the "your brain is done cooking" [at 25] thing. I 
wonder what it will take for this myth to go away.
Who knows? Maybe a court case where expert witnesses tear it apart limb from limb?
I will reply to the brain doctor and I'm going to trust that you're a brain doctor.
I've always thought this was true and I'm willing to have my 
understanding changed so please understand I'm asking in good faith.
This article from the NIHsays the following:
In fact, there are characteristic developmental changes that 
almost all adolescents experience during their transition from childhood
 to adulthood. It is well established that the brain undergoes a 
“rewiring” process that is not complete until approximately 25 years of 
age.
The prefrontal cortex is one of the last regions of the brain to 
reach maturation, which explains why some adolescents exhibit behavioral
 immaturity. There are several executive functions of the human 
prefrontal cortex that remain under construction during adolescence, as 
illustrated inFigures 3and4.
 The fact that brain development is not complete until near the age of 
25 years refers specifically to the development of the prefrontal 
cortex.
and for context, while I do have an issue with some age gap relationships, 22-27 feels like a pretty normal range for me.
As a neuropsychologist, that is exactly it. There is an overruling
 of the limbic system OVER the frontal brain during adolescence. Which 
translates into: emotional reactions are overpowering to rational 
decisions. This does settle with age, approximately around when 
adolescence ends which corresponds to ages 21-24 in the case of brain 
development
You're basically saying "you can't grow a beard till 16 years old".
And then you see mfs at 23 starting to sprout baby hairs, while other kids had stubble at 13.
Do people not understand how averages work? And how scattered a population can be?
This is basically the best answer. Expanding a bit,
The prefrontal cortex continues to develop beyond 25
There’s massive individual variability to when one’s prefrontal 
cortex develops to the level of a “mature adult”, however you define 
that. Age 25 might be a somewhat reasonable number for the population as
 whole, but it’s similar to guessing an individual’s IQ based on group 
averages.
So in other words, junk science?
Studies like these are often seeing what I call “cultural 
correlation”. The older we get, the less pressure there is to learn — we
 get stable jobs, have families, etc and focus less on learning.
Those of us that are lifelong learners know the brain never stops 
developing as long as you keep exercising it (and barring any sort of 
disease of course), it’s a muscle in that way.
This, I'm so tired of people constantly saying the "your brain 
isn't done developing til 25" bs, they don't even know what they're 
talking about. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Or just anytime you have a conversation with 
someone older and they disagree with you, they go "how old are you," and
 your answer is below 25, your opinion is immediately invalid.
To be fair, 25 is about the age I started realizing I DIDNT know everything. A valuable lesson to this day.
Did 7 years of adulthood have anything to do with it? Or was it on your 25th birthday that everything snapped into place?

[Amazing_Rise_6233]: People under 21/22 aredoomedby TikTok brainrot.
 It’s happening at such an alarming rate. Not to mention, these people 
had their brain development stunted from Covid.
I wonder if that's why they unironically and without embarassment say "but I'm such a babyyyyyyy" as a legal adult.
Yup it’s pretty much self-infantilization. It’s so bad with people
 within that age group. They still see themselves as literal minors due 
to their stunted brain development. They were still very much teenagers 
and were still in mandatory school when Covid hit so it makes sense why 
they act like this.
I'm so confused how they got so self-infantilized that they 
unironically see themselves that way. When I was 18, my peers and I were
 excited to be getting our first crappy apartment (with roommates 'cause
 we weren't rich), being independent and going to college and dating and
 figuring shit out on our own. Calling ourselves a "baby" at 18 would 
have been freaking social suicide.
Before I get accused of being a boomer, mandatory statement that 
I'm not that much older than the oldest of Gen Z, we'll leave it at 
that.

[[deleted]]: Some people are really dumb. 18 is the adult age, thats all it is, nothing higher, and never anything lower
I think the point is, once you reach your 30s you realize that 
people 18-20 are still “kids” in terms of mentality, experience, 
attitude, etc. I don’t mean that in any offensive way, that’s just how 
it is. Are those people still adults? Sure. Are they VERY different from
 from people 25+? Absolutely they are.
And once you're in your 40s you realized 30 year olds are still kids making stupid decisions
And once 50, you realize tons of people regardless of age still act like they're in high school and never left.

 something that this is weird to them. In my day (not that long ago) we

[BedroomTimely4361]: This generation is a little too obsessed with pretending to be a 
child for a long as possible and when someone near their age is treated 
like an adult it destroys that entire self perception. They’re so 
delusional about it they try to assert that these mega rich celebrities 
have to give a shit about their opinions.
Wait until Americans find out that in most countries there 
literally isn’t a “teenage” phase. You’re a child, you keep growing up 
until you’re considered an adult based on how you act. No a magical age 
like 18, 25, 28 or whatever the fuck these bored children decide is the 
“adult” age during that conversation.

You're only allowed to date people that were born on the same day as you.

[BackgroundTime8298]: Cause they wanna be irresponsible with the excuse that they aren’t “mentally developed yet”
No bish, you are a grown ass adult. Act like one.
[NoxTempus]: Serious answer? You lack perspective.
I lacked perspective at that 20-ish, so did the generation before me, and so will the generation that comes after you.
I'm a younger millennial and my perspective is still changing and growing over time.
Having a problem with a 3 year age gap at 26 is so silly that I 
literally cannot believe it is real. Assuming that it was somehow a real
 opinion, it was formed by someone who cannot comprehend that 17-20 is 
different to 23-26.
[TemporaryMaterial992]: It’s definitely odd. I see it a lot as well. Age gaps truly depend
 on what the ages are. And it’s so situational it’s unfair to lump every
 age gap into this. But these examples are just brutal.
[[deleted]]: Yall are fuckin weird
[SlightPossibility898]: Just because you're figuring out the basics of adulting in your early 20s doesn't mean you're somehow not an adult.
[Big_Iron_Cowboy]: I’m 30 and my wife is 24. Married when she was 23.
[emsexistential]: I think there’s something to say about maturity levels, but 22 IS an adult.
[Reaper3955]: It's because alot Gen Zers lost those prime years between like 
15-22 due to covid and it stunted their growth and they're desperate to 
artificially extend the youth they feel like they lost. Like I was 
working full time in an office by 20 lmao. Meanwhile 22 year old Gen 
zers are like what is a deductible I'm just a 22 year old baby.
[Limon-Pepino]: Too much internet time.
[VisioningHail]: Because our generation are developmentally challenged puritans lol
[DeathRaeGun]: Well, I’m 28 and I’m dating a 23-year-old, so apparently I’m a “groomer”.
I think the “prefrontal lobe development” crowd don’t understand 
granularity. The lobe develops gradually, it’s not like the lobe pops 
into existence out of nowhere on your 25thbirthday.

TÍTULO: Why do gen zs have all or nothing mindset and always comparing themselves to other people? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I see this in youtube and ig. Posts like
"The amount of work needed to be an average runner (they're not happy about their pace 5 5k)"
"If you're not making any progress in the gym, then there is no point going"(or something along the line)
Irl i see this as well. Im a 23 years old gen z. In the university
 fair, we have like an endoscopic surgery tool practice game where 
players pick up beads and put them in slots, and the team that does it 
the fastest wins. There was a group of 18 years old girls there was a 
hiccup with one player which slowed the team down. Towards the end when 
we were counting the scores i heard one od the girls say to her friend 
'what's the point of counting, we're not winning anyways' and they 
proceed to play with their phone instead of listening
It seems a lot of gen z people seem to revile the ideal of 
struggling or failing. They seem to think they should suceed on 
everything the first time effortlessly
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Chemical-Village-211]: 100% narcissism. The level of narcissism and entitlement among our peers is wild.
[Azulan5]: most young people are like that, thats why they need someone older
 pushing them to succeed. Most stereotypes of GenZ are stereotypes of 
young people.
[Jsaun906]: Human jealousy has been written about in the oldest known texts. It's not a new phenomenon. It's basic human nature.
[itchylol742]: because theres like 700 million gen z and a large enough group of 
people will have extremely diverse opinions just due to the extreme 
large numbers. like if you got 700 million people at least one of them 
would be a serial killer

[First_Nectarine_4289]: GenZ has grown up in a time where the societal expectation for 
instant gratification has matched our technological capabilities. This 
is just a personal observation, of course, but no wonder none of you 
have the patience to wait for a reward that might come on a longer-term 
scale rather than Prime’s two-day delivery guarantee.
[DependentImmediate40]: Because social media is designed that way! It’s made to make you 
feel miserable and meaningless in life when you see someone born years 
younger than you so much far ahead in life than you’ll ever be. It’s all
 text on a screen and you shouldn’t let these people/influencers get 
over your head since they don’t know you nor do you know them.
I had to delete twitter and tik tok because it got far too much. I
 am such in a race I feel to always be somewhere the sooner I least 
expect it. But that’s just not the reality for me I feel. Because it is a
 lot of trail and error to just get things right in the hopes that maybe
 the next day will be different.
Fuck social media, it’s all fabricated AI generated BS made to 
make you feel far behind in life. apologies for the rant
[[deleted]]: A constant feeling of lost time and stunted growth.
People have a deep insecurity for things they lack and if it takes
 time to get those things, it feels like adding on to their deficit.
The only way to make up for the lost time is instant success.
And unless a millionaire decides to descend fromr/wallstreetbetsto grace your cash-app with enough money to make up for your wasted 20s, you're always going to be in a debt to yourself.
The only thing that services the debt is numbing yourself of the emotional cost of wasted effort.

TÍTULO: why do people act like you're on a high horse for believing in human rights : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
im so sick of how fervently ignorant people are. Being homophobic 
or racist is not just a difference in opinion it actively causes 
pointless restraint and division in society that no one benefits from 
unless you're a politician. So when someone calls you out for upholding 
shitty beliefs its not to stroke their own ego and feel superior its 
because they want to see their country change for the better.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[theghostwiththetoast]: The “in-group / out-group” psychology is so prevalent in this country, it ought to be talked about more.
[kevinleefiedler]: Nice one, take my upvote


[Wonderful-Impact5121]: Change isn’t always good, clearly. I believe that’s what they were referring to.
If you move too fast too enthusiastically as a culture or as a 
society you can easily become much more oppressive, much more racist, 
much more homophobic, much more fascist, etc. there is value in the 
balancing act.
Can you give me an American example?
[elrayo]: Can you give me an American example?
[[deleted]]: I don't believe many people have a disdain for human rights. I do 
think some people have a disdain for what some call "luxury beliefs." 
Which are a set of viewpoints that one gains social capital for, without
 there being any onus on the individual to take action in favor of these
 beliefs. But! I don't think that gay acceptance, or not being racist 
are typically on the list of luxury beliefs. Despite a loud minority of 
manosphere followers on the internet, I still believe that most people 
believe that being racist and homophobic are bad things. tdlr: the high 
horse idea is connected to luxury beliefs. Not to anti-racism or a 
belief that LGBTQ+ should have rights.
EDIT: i'm not sure what about this deserves downvotes, but fairs ig
100% agree, some examples of luxury beliefs are;
- Defund the police
- Lax immigration policies
- Drug legalization
- Single parent households are just as capable as two parent households
“I don’t believe many people have a disdain for human rights.”
Care to explain how laws restricting healthcare for trans 
individuals fits into your narrative? It’s a central talking point 
amongst conservatives and actively legislated. That’s just one 
incredibly easy example to counter your point.
Edit: lmao I’ve linked multiple articles from the APA (the largest
 psych organization in the world and the one my colleagues and I all 
use) and all this guy has done in the replies is spout conspiracy 
theories. Transphobes are wild.
Trans people are getting cosmetic surgeries, not life-saving 
operations they’ll die without. That’s why we (the taxpayers) shouldnt 
have to put our taxes towards them. Should we start paying for people’s 
nose jobs too?
Look, trans people have the right to live, love, and be happy. They donothave the right to take my hard-earned money or resources and use it for
 their own personal wants. Cosmetic surgery is not a right, it is a 
luxury.
Reread my comment and then try again.
I wasn’t advocating for universal healthcare (even though I 
support it) or even for government healthcare to cover trans healthcare.
 I was specifically addressing how conservatives are attempting to ban 
procedures.
Your comment has fucking nothing to do with what I said lmao.
Gender Affirming Care is not just surgeries, but hormones/hormone 
blockers, correct clothing, etc but also GAC is not just for trans 
people but straight cis people too. Whatever reinforces your sense of 
femininity or masculinity is gender affirming care whether that’s a 
Brazilian Butt Lift or a giant pickup truck or muscle car.
GAC, surgery and hormones in particular, is life saving for trans 
people. The suicide rate of trans people before and after treatment is 
night and day. Some surgeries are cosmetic like facial feminization 
surgery but the most common ones are the most life saving which are 
double mastectomy and hysterectomy(trans men) and sexual reassignment 
surgery(trans woman). Trans people receiving this treatment and hormones
 literally saves lives.
Taxpayer dollars paying for these treatments through Medicaid is 
no different than Medicaid paying for treatment for other conditions 
like cancer, organ failure, etc. which btw are often the result of 
personal choices unlike being trans which is not a choice.
So why is it ok for Republicans to make it illegal for adults to get those surgeries with their own money?
You don't know what you're talking about because you aren't the 
kind of person who reads arXiv for fun. Passability is a comorbidity of 
transsexual people in multiple dimensions, the research and statistics 
overwhelmingly substantiate this, and WPATH guidelines are 
evidence-based recommendations written according to these.
every argument i've seen about this is focused on underaged 
children and puberty blockers. once adulthood is reached, there is much 
more bipartison agreement. though of course, conservatives don't love 
it.
Do you think minors getting access to potentially life saving and life altering healthcare is a luxury belief?
The medical community has consensus on gender affirming care, 
should we override the medical community because people think it’s icky?
Deluded. Wake up.

If a nation has horrible treatment of LGBTQ people you won't find me marching for it.
I'm sure this is a well thought out stance regarding which 
"nations" you support and not entirely based off vibes which are largely
 influenced by situational media depictions.
Also, by your very own logic, if an LGBT person is killed in a 
war, whether or not you will "march for them" is based on whether the 
nation they are living in supports them. This is not a coherent 
worldview.
Most people online don’t even take 10 seconds to think about what 
they’re typing. It’s all just a weird ego trip of appearing just. I’ll 
support any country that’s being wrecked by war regardless of their 
views about me, simply because I treat people the way I want to be 
treated.

The problem is that you should not generalize an entire nation and
 disregard the suffering of that nation because some individuals within 
it are bigots.

[Happy-Viper]: What “human rights”?
Because even though believing homophobic beliefs is vile… it’s not a violation of any human rights.
Indeed, it literally is a right to have your own distinct beliefs, and to be able to voice them.
Homophobic beliefs often result in people booting for policies 
that infringe on LGBTQ rights (and honestly by an extent, everyone).
“Passing homophobic laws” seems pretty distinct from what OP is 
talking about, just being homophobic, and accordingly, creating division
 in society.

That’s shitty, but seems like a failure of the school in its 
duties as an employer and respecting equal treatment of employees, thus 
breaching the teacher’s rights, rather than the random homophobic 
assholes breaching the teacher’s rights.
I don’t think there are cases in the world where gay people have 
their rights breached; there definitely are. But OP seems to be 
suggesting a random John Doe’s homophobia is a breach of rights, rather 
than just vile behaviour.
It's not about beliefs though, it's about wanting those homophobic beliefs enforced in law
OP didn’t mention laws, though. Being homophobic is quite distinct from that.
Wanting to restrict gay people’s rights? Obviously a violation of 
human rights. Being homophobic? Evil, but not a restriction of human 
rights.
ok then, lets try a different way of wording this- what beliefs to
 homophobes have towards gay people that do not involve gay people 
losing their rights in the homophobe's ideal world? because that's the 
core issue. the core issue is the idea that in that person's ideal 
reality you wouldn't exist as yourself. and they're entitled to that i 
guess, but everyone else is equally entitled to react to that however 
they see fit, including negatively
No one is saying you can’t think ur own beliefs - it is just about
 whether it makes u an asshole or not. So many free speech absolutists 
worried about rights when we’re just saying they’re mean-spirited 
bigots- not breaking any law tho.
But OP is talking about human rights.
Being an asshole is an entirely distinct topic to that. Yeah, you 
can and should call out assholes. But how does human rights fit into 
this?

[Appropriate-Food1757]: “Virtue signaling” = I’m a bigot and everyone else is too they pretend to care about other people.
[[deleted]]: It might be because a lot of ppl have hijacked several movements 
for validation, views, and likes on social media that it waters down the
 actual movement and purpose. With so many disingenuous and bad actors 
involved it's hard to prove a point even if you're in the right.
[Dunkmaxxing]: Look at how most humans will support the mass enslavement torture 
and mutilation of animals for a bit of sensory pleasure all while they 
are entirely unable to resist, can it really be at all surprising they 
don't care about people either? The truth is, most people lack 
meaningful empathy and want their immediate desires satisfied. They also
 don't experience what it is like to be on the receiving end of 
mistreatment and are ok with using might makes right as an argument as 
long as they personally are not the victim, but of course if they were 
it would suddenly be a problem. Basically, apathy, hypocrisy, 
entitlement.

There’s certainly a tendency towards certain maxims
I don't know what your beliefs on human rights are, but whatever 
they are I propose you are the first recipient of said treatment.
A lot of y'all hate any kind of common moral ground including "the golden rule".
whats so hard about basic respect people already hate a person 
without meeting them because of things like racism and homophobia
What's considered " basic respect" isn't universal
If a person breathes, they should be treated with certain respects.
Privacy, identity, etc.
If someone doesn't agree with this at the very least, then they do not respect human rights or basic respect.
thats why I uphold people to a certain standard
Morality is completely subjective the same way the idea of human 
rights is completely a social construct. With that in mind, what 
concepts of human rights that some hold, do you disagree with?

[Kawaiithemlin]: Guilt.
[User_identificationZ]: I would probably say that when all of this kicked off in 
2016/2017, a few dumbasses acted holier-than-thou about their beliefs, 
and unfortunately they got amplified by the News. Now, because of that, 
some people automatically correlate “promoting human rights” with “they 
think they’re better than us, fuck ‘em.”
[TheGalator]: This is so silly. People don't think transphobia is is good. 
People think making 3 toilets for men/women/diverse isn't transphobia. 
Big difference.
For the record i - probably - don't disagree with your values. But
 I disagree on how you go about this issue the complete lack of 
understanding to the other side is worrying. How you ever gonna change 
stuff that way?
[elrayo]: Because you immediately make everyone else feel bad for only giving a fuck about themselves.
I’m saying this as someone that doesn’t do as much as I should and
 I feel this guilt. I don’t give into “who cares” because I have a thing
 called empathy. A gift and a curse.
if someone is being racist fuck their feelings we should care more
 about the victims then them. they have the power to change as a person 
if someone has a racist mindset its not set in stone they could be 
better people. But as of now they actively harm people in society.
[Burn3rAcc0unt6]: if someone is being racist fuck their feelings we should care more
 about the victims then them. they have the power to change as a person 
if someone has a racist mindset its not set in stone they could be 
better people. But as of now they actively harm people in society.
[Individual-Heart-719]: Because they know they support or are indifferent to 
cruelty/exploitation/prejudice and claim they don’t care and want to 
drag you down to their level so that they don’t feel shitty for not 
caring.
[Z-e-n-o]: The same reason you use "people" to refer to a specific subset of dumbasses who hold stupid beliefs.
Next someone else will make a post along the lines of "why do 
people say stupid things are human rights with no justification." Then 
you'll have a back and forth echo on the comments of each with people 
arguing against the worst views of the opposition while accomplishing 
nothing.
There's nothing productive about any of this, it's just another way to feel better than someone else.
Bo tf its not the whole reason we have better human rights than 
back in the early 1900's is because people protested. Hell look at the 
blair mountain strikes the bosses pulled out Gatling guns and bombed the
 workers for going on strike but they still persisted and pushed for a 
better tomorrow so we should have the same sentiment until society 
treats everyone right.
Then go protest. Making a validation post on reddit is a world away from organized protest.
I do protest you could do more than one thing in your life
That's good for you but it has nothing to do with my original comment

[Iamscaredofpeople69]: Narcissism and a false sense of self importance
[r1Zero]: Because you make them feel bad for not believing in them.
[j4ded3mo]: I think it’s a subconscious insecure reaction to people who have 
the capability to feel empathy. I HAD a Maga buddy who I would always 
retort ethical beliefs with “well why don’t you move them in and feed 
them” when talking about homeless or immigrants. I don’t have the means 
to do so but if I had a billion dollars I would be more than willing to 
pay my fair share to do so. We are all trying to barely get by in this 
economy/society that responsibility doesn’t solely land on an individual
 to house and feed homeless immigrants, fund education etc
[G00chstain]: Curious as to what rights they don’t have? Find it hard for this 
to come up in conversation with a stranger or even an acquaintance
women have lost reproductive rights, people are trying to get rid 
of gay marriage, people spread lies about transgender people so some 
people end up killing them. ICE is mass deporting people with no due 
process hell they detained a Native American in my state.

[Impossible_Earth8429]: Peoples beliefs by their standards may not be shitty or wrong 
especially when it’s wrapped up in their culture or religion and calling
 them out isn’t going to change how they think or feel about these 
things. Look at a lot of countries around the world where the 
populations are homogeneous in race and religion. Homosexuality isn’t 
widely accepted amongst a lot of cultures and neither is interracial 
dating or marriage. Sometimes it’s easier to learn why someone feels a 
certain way about a topic than telling them why their beliefs are wrong.
I grew up in a very religious and racist community and people 
called me out and I was able to change. so sitting around and sweeping 
problems under the rug wont fix the issue.

TÍTULO: Why Do So Many Girls Fall for Narcissists? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
I was talking to someone the other day about relationships, and we
 got into the whole “why do so many girls fall for narcissists?” thing. 
Like, why do toxic people seem so attractive at first? It’s easy to say 
“just avoid red flags”..but let’s be real, if it were that simple, this 
wouldn’t be such a common problem.
The thing is, narcissists don’t show up looking like villains. 
They show up as confident, charming, and magnetic. And here’s where it 
gets messy...society actually encourages a lot of these traits in guys. 
We’re told that confidence is hot. That being bold and self-assured is 
attractive. That having “main character energy” is something to admire. 
And that’s true… until it’s not.
At first, a narcissist makes you feel like you’re the most 
important person in the world. The love bombing stage is intense. They 
mirror your best qualities, make you feel special, and their attention 
can feel addictive. But then the mask slips. That confidence starts 
looking more like control. That charm turns into gaslighting. And by the
 time you realize something’s off, you’re already emotionally invested.
So, is this really about girls choosing the wrong people..or are 
we lowkey conditioned to mistake narcissistic traits for strength and 
attractiveness? And more importantly..how do you unlearn that?
But fr, let’s talk, have you ever looked back and realized you 
fell for someone because of the same traits that later hurt you? Do you 
think society plays a role in what we find attractive?
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Ambitious-Builder780]: "dying to be asked out" 💀💀💀💀💀
Yeah by attractive men. I hate how disillusioned you reddit people are.
[QuestionSign]: Y'all listening to social media and not having a real life to experience on your own 🤷🏾‍♂️
[Still-Power758]: Dude there’s too many people doing this for you to believe it 
doesn’t happen I’ve had relationships myself at work even though I 
shouldn’t I’ve seen coworkers and people at parties hit it off almost 
every job I had working in in large groups or every good party I’ve 
attended
[vr1252]: I mean I do get it but I think if you’re respectful there 
shouldn’t be an issue. I also think people need to approach others as 
trying to make friends first and I’ve told him that. Just try to make a 
new friend and then maybe see where things go, I think that’s a huge 
difference.
When women are saying men are creeps it’s because they were being 
actually CREEPY. I’ve never felt a bad way about a man being genuinely 
respectful and wanting to get to know me more in a respectful manner.
[Agreeable-Ideal2846]: I did this once when I was 14 but it took me on that day I did ask
 her out a ton of build up lol, still she had feelings for me and we 
dated for a bit freshman year but currently am single and haven’t had a 
crush for awhile, can’t wait for me to inevitably turn into the shy 
oblivious guy when I do tho
[piratecheese13]: I think it’s less that confidence is attractive and more that a 
lack of confidence is such a barrier to being in a position where you 
can be attractive in the wild
It's not rocket science.
It's because men are the only gender that is expected to approach the opposite gender.
It's that simple.
[vegetables-10000]: It's not rocket science.
It's because men are the only gender that is expected to approach the opposite gender.
It's that simple.
[Megotaku]: Confidence is attractive in everyone. You don't walk into a 
doctor's office, listen to your woman doctor waffle, hedge and struggle 
for 15 minutes with your diagnosis and then leave feeling comfortable. 
The reality is confidence opens doors literally everywhere, which is why
 it's a universally attractive trait.
[lonjerpc]: I think a big part of it is simply conflating confidence and 
attractiveness. We assume good looking men are confident and 
unattractive men are not even when they are behaving identically. Then 
there is the snowball effect of being attractive causing better 
reactions in others which encourages confidence. Then the association 
builds in the reverse direction.
Confidence in and of it's self is certainly attractive but I do think it is overstated.
[WySLatestWit]: It's attractive to literally everyone, of every gender.

Here is where terms are not being used the same. When people talk 
about men needing to be "confident", they're not talking about being 
independent, happy with oneself, not clingy, and not needing daily 
approval, they're talking about being sexually aggressive in pursuing 
women.
Men absolutely prefer women who are competent and pleasant to be 
around, and that's why men go for those kinds of women. But when it 
comes to the inverse, for all of the talk about "confidence", women 
generally speaking aren't going after the men who are confident in 
taking things slow and happy taking their time. Just think about it, we 
don't say women aren't confident because they're not out there actively 
pursuing men, yet "confident= sexually aggressive" for men is so 
thoroughly linked that I'm sure there'll be people reading my comment 
who will have whiplash hearing "confident man" and "happy not chasing 
after women".
Confidence isn't nearly as important to men as it is to women.
As long as she's a good person, pleasant to be around, etc I don't really care how confident a woman is
I like some clinginess yes. There's a balance where a little bit 
of codependence and clingy can be cute. It's when it's extreme that it's
 a turn off. But them showing that they want to be with you and spend 
their time with you is cute yes.

[jellomizer]: The old Bible quote "Ask and you shall receive" Confidence 
especially at a younger age gives you the advantage. You can get away 
with crimes, as well most people are uncertain themselves so a confident
 person is easy to follow.
[SockNo948]: "confidence" isn't the best adjective but it conveys status. girls are looking for the guys who are essentiallyin charge.it's cues of authority, importance, and, probably, self-interest. girls
 like the bad guys because they can articulate and express - and 
probably effect - their interests, often at other people's expense. 
that's interesting.
[Due_Masterpiece_3601]: I think a lot of confident guys are not going to clubs and know what they want. Narcissism isn't the same as confidence.
No, but people with narcissism tend to have a lot of confidence
Some of them do and some of them don't.
[piratecheese13]: No, but people with narcissism tend to have a lot of confidence
Some of them do and some of them don't.
[Due_Masterpiece_3601]: Some of them do and some of them don't.
[WintersDoomsday]: “He changed”
No, he didn’t. You just finally paid attention to who he was all along.
[Pastel_Aesthetic9]: It only is a net positive these days given that at the end you 
will come out successful eventually. 1 rejection can wreck a person but 
for them 100 is nothing
[[deleted]]: Yeah it turns out shitty people think very highly of themselves
Who would have thought?
[Educational_Mud3637]: The narcissism is an effect, not a cause, of being attractive to women
Similar reason girls seem to like "abusive guys"- those guys 
became abusive once they realized they can get away with it/another girl
 would always be willing to get with him once he's done with the first 
girl.
[Kevin7650]: I feel like you answered your own question in the second paragraph.
The question is just there to get your attention. The post is an explanation as to why it happens.
[burgerking351]: The question is just there to get your attention. The post is an explanation as to why it happens.
[CaramelImpossible406]: Cos ladies like those characters, it’s not society that says for 
them to. It’s nature. Once you understand nature you’ll understand why 
ladies fall for these types of guys.
"But I can CHANGE him!"
They don’t even believe that. It’s just what they tell other 
people when they see the bruises or hear about his drug addiction
I think it’s a combination of society and nature tbh.
[recordman410]: "But I can CHANGE him!"
They don’t even believe that. It’s just what they tell other 
people when they see the bruises or hear about his drug addiction
[gandalftheorange11]: They don’t even believe that. It’s just what they tell other 
people when they see the bruises or hear about his drug addiction
[No-Anywhere3790]: I think it’s a combination of society and nature tbh.
[[deleted]]: I would like to add that not all narcissists are extraoverted or 
are even good at being narcisscists. As in, they do not have charisma or
 anything like that. There are plenty of supposedly shy, sweet, nice 
guys who turn fucking crazy. And there are plenty of them that give off 
wacko vibes from the start. Point is, anyone can be an abusive, 
manipulative, and arrogant person who thinks they're above everyone 
else. Getting into this sort of situation can happen to anyone. Men, 
women, anyone. And yeah, certain folks are even actively targeted. 
That's why some of the sweetest people have like the worst relationship 
history.
[LegOk4997]: and that’s true… until it’s not
Aristotle wrote about this like 2000 years ago. The children yearn for Aristotelian ethics
[PSXSnack09]: i heard that for every yes a narcissists gets, they get like 100 
no s (in the case of men at least), is just that whenever it happens, 
the parties involved tend to be quite vocal about it.
anyways not everything that shines is gold and you dont wanna be 
like those guys even though it initially looks like they get a lot of 
success, they get cheated on and abused a lot (although they tend to 
abuse and cheat back too) they dont get the unconditional love or 
validation you might want
[fadedv1]: Bc they are often attractive, and because of their pretty privilege they develop narcissism in the first place
[PsychologyAdept669]: i mean i think it's more about entitlement and the fact that 
entitled people are not going to be assholes right off the bat, because 
entitlement is all about getting whatever they can get for themselves 
while suffering the least amount of consequences. In an early 
relationship there's no established emotional bond so an entitled 
person, gender and other traits irrelevant, is going to be displaying 
their "good behavior" and following the social rules because they simply
 can't get away with  not putting that effort in. But once that 
emotional bond is there, if you let an entitled person start dropping 
the slack in terms of how they treat you and your relationship, they're 
just going to keep pushing it for as long as they can justify it, 
because it benefits them in the short-term to continue to get 100% of 
the relationship benefits with less than 100% of the initial effort.
The way to not end up dating an asshole is to just have firm, 
methodical boundaries. Hold up your end of the relationship-bargain, be 
100% accountable, have a handle on your own emotions and behavior so 
that the other person never has an excuse to fall back on to justify 
their own entitlement. "treat them how you want to be treated" so that 
you can hit them with the "I'm not treating you like that, so i would 
appreciate if you didn't treat me like that" and they'll have literally 
no argument because it's true, lol. Entitled people feed off of 
emotional reactions to their entitlement, positive or negative, because 
these things allow them to feel as if they're justified. Take that away 
and they just look like an asshole, lol. and  if they still refuse to 
reciprocate respect, then firmly decline to engage with them until they 
meet you halfway.
It always comes down to cost vs benefit nobody is going to keep 
acting like a petulant baby if their partner responds to that with "ok 
well just lmk when you're done then" and gives them absolutely nothing. 
but if you try to coddle them or get upset you're allowing them to 
control your emotional narrative and one way or another reinforces their
 perception of themselves as a victim rather than an autonomous 
individual.
I think society plays a role in telling people with less societal 
power that they should tolerate unequal interpersonal relationships.
[Charming_Review_735]: Narcissists often have excellent cognitive empathy so can be very charming.
And a lot of times they're willing to put in effort up front
This this this. Narcissists can easily be smart enough to know 
that acting like an entitled asshole is counterproductive to their 
goals. They will say whatever they think makes them sound like a "good 
person" until they know they don't have to maintain the facade anymore.
[[deleted]]: And a lot of times they're willing to put in effort up front
[BernoullisQuaver]: This this this. Narcissists can easily be smart enough to know

goals. They will say whatever they think makes them sound like a "good

[Expert_Constant_9550]: well when a guy is attractive its quite easy to overlook their 
obvious flaws. its not the narcissism thats hot, its that, on top of the
 looks. a guy who appears confident who also has the looks to back it up
 will always be considered attractive on a surface level. whether this 
is good for long term relationships, i dont know.
[Happily_Doomed]: Because narcissists are charming and most people don't constantly 
expect to get lied to. People generally want to believe in the good in 
people, so when they meet someone that's presenting goodness they want 
to believe it
[Edgyusername69420]: Height + Face.
[[deleted]]: Women are gullible
Humans*
[[deleted]]: Humans*
[Due_Masterpiece_3601]: A lot of good looking guys are narcissists because they are used 
to getting away with it. That feeds into a positive feedback loop and 
they just hit on everyone. As for why women are interested, narcissism 
looks like confidence but they are not the same, it's possible to be one
 or the other but they kind of appear the same.
[[deleted]]: Its because they want that genetic material.  This is why 
psycopathy, which is entirely genetic, is still around today. Its 
probably a dark truth we don't want to acknowledge, but those genes were
 valuable and seen as attractive at one point, and that legacy is still 
around now.
This is why serial killers get so many female penpals.
[Sarcatsticthecat]: It’s because narcs often start by using tactics to make their mark feel special such as love bombing
[Typical-Mushroom4577]: why do so many people generalize
[Exotic_Resource_6200]: Well apparently white Males loves them also seeing they overwhelming voted for one twice.
[Delli-paper]: So, is this really about girls choosing the wrong people..or are 
we lowkey conditioned to mistake narcissistic traits for strength and 
attractiveness?
100% yes. Women falling for a bad deal from a used car salesman 
without the title is no different from one with the title. You need to 
learn to evaluate people and use your brain.
And more importantly..how do you unlearn that?
Learn to spot a used car salesman when you see one. They have, like, three tricks they use on repeat.
But fr, let’s talk, have you ever looked back and realized you 
fell for someone because of the same traits that later hurt you?
No, I learn from my mistakes.
Do you think society plays a role in what we find attractive?
Of course it does. So does biology But so do you. You don't eat 
every chocolate cake you see, you don't step into every house, you don't
 drink every soda,and you shouldn't jump on every guy who seems attractive at first pass, either.
[Finlaycarter2002]: Geez I hope that's not what I come off as, as im quite an 
introvert and have been trying be more confident, more bold in how I 
look and it works, it get people to talk to me. It's probably not but 
man I wpuld be telling a lie if I said this didn't make me feel a little
 self conscious.
[CatchMeWritinDirty]: One of the traits of a motivated narcissist is specifically to 
present as something they’re not, but also to target the people who they
 believe they can lie to successfully. They’re professional con artists 
& it’s scary how well they can masquerade as lovable people in 
society.
[sugaryver]: Girls are conditioned to be people pleasers by society. Even in a 
toxic relationship, they will ignore red flags since maybe if they just 
try harder, they can fix the relationship. They don't want to give up 
while many men find it easier to walk out on a relationship that harms 
them.
No one believes them when they tell others about the red flags 
either. They just tell them it’s their own fault for picking men poorly.
 It’s a lose/lose situation for women. They have to make every 
relationship work with every man ever or they’re a high maintenance 
bitch, and if the relationship doesn’t work it’s their fault for picking
 poorly. I’m not surprised why so many straight women would rather just 
be single.
[celestial-milk-tea]: No one believes them when they tell others about the red flags

[Tiumars]: You answered your question yourself. narcissists show the traits 
most women are attracted to, and you might learn the truth about them 
much later.
[Capistrano9]: Damn so many of these comments are just “nice guys” saying girls 
always go for the bad boys or only tall guys. Cmon dudes, its not that 
deep. Grow a personality, that’s literally what these “narcissists” have
 and you don’t. I know OP isn’t an incel and this isnt that kind of post
 but the comments sure make it feel like it
[00rgus]: Because most guys start off as just confident and charismatic and 
then once they get the girl they get a massive ego boost and think they 
are the coolest in the room and then they become toxic and then the girl
 is perceived to be a narcissist liker because that's how her mans 
became
[davidellis23]: I mean is it actually more common than other types of people? 
Women fall for all kinds of people. Some of them are going to be 
narcissists
[Huey-Mchater]: Idk why you’re getting all misogynistic with it yah dumb dumb. 
PEOPLE fall for narcissists. Across the board they’re charming to the 
majority of people pretty consistently. Putting it on women is some 
garbage you need to get out of here with.
[[deleted]]: Comment removed by moderator
Western society regularly rewards individualistic behaviors and 
values them more. That could play a role in attraction. Many women have 
also been taught to value romantic connection more than anything else so
 they often overlook major issues or are told "it's not that bad". A 
combo of those 2 factors is most likely why you're seeing what you're 
seeing.
Building close/intimate relationships in a society that believes 
you don't owe anyone anything is inevitably going to result in you 
dating a few assholes.

[Acceptable_String_52]: They mistake the narcissism for confidence
[tshue93]: If you don’t love yourself how can you expect someone to else to?
Thats not really helpful☹️
[Finlaycarter2002]: Thats not really helpful☹️
[Dangerous-Acadia-314]: "jUSt Be coNfiDEnt! Confidence is attractive!"
[layered_dinge]: They don't "fall for" narcissists, they select for narcissists.
[INTJ_Innovations]: Because like attracts like.
[Gsomethepatient]: Because some people confuse arrogance with confidence
[[deleted]]: Because they are tall and attractive
[FatBussyFemboys]: Cause we are literally the coolest most awesome most attractive 
people available, super modest and attractive and always right. Duh
[Imperium-Claims]: Very carefully
[robocam001]: Reminds me of the LEGO study. They found that when boys play with a
 Batman figure, they want to become Batman. They imagine themselves as 
Batman.
Girls however want to change Batman into the traits they like. 
They'll slap a dress on him and turn Batman into themselves.
Women see what they want to see when it comes to men. They will 
ignore every red flag on earth and delude themselves into believing they
 are different than they are.
And yes. Looks has a lot to do with it. If they like the way he 
looks, then they will just delude themselves into thinking he has all 
the other traits they want him to have too.
[MaximumTrick2573]: Confidence, narcissism, and being male, are not necessarily 
correlated. Plenty of introvert and female narcissists out there too. 
This is just one brand. The general idea is the same though, they sell 
one version of themselves, and the their partner is left waiting for 
that version to come back.
[Spirited-Feed-9927]: I think it is due to our normal courting.  It benefits people who 
are aggressive.  Early in a relationship, the incentives are all set up 
for everyone.  The side of the narcissist they like is showing.  Then 
you get into it, and after boredom or comfort or whatever.  The bad side
 of the narcissist comes to bear.  I just think its a cycle that is 
unavoidable in many cases.  People say look for signs, but if the signs 
were there early no one would stay.  They take time before they show, 
and a level of commitment is already there.
[Southern_Dig_9460]: Women especially young women are kind of known for having bad taste in men. So it’s partially also their flaw
[Short_Row195]: To answer the title, it's basically cause their arrogance is misinterpreted as confidence.
[Capistrano9]: Narcissist is a word that is thrown at multiple characteristics 
and personality quirks. Not everything is a medical diagnosis. Some guys
 just suck
[LastInALongChain]: non gen z here. The advice I received at your age was "Perception 
is reality". Two people can act identically, but the person who is 
perceived better will have everyone take their opinions in a much better
 light, more immediately. A narcissist is running an optimized algorithm
 they picked up out of terror of being perceived badly. They make 
excellent short term plays that are highly engaging to people they just 
meet. Typically they end up destroying themselves, or jumping ship to a 
new place using previously earned social capital before the train 
crashes. People don't know you, and won't know you for a long time, so 
their strategy is great for every form of initial encounter, even if 
they are void of any substance in the long run.
The best way to suss them out is to let a new, charismatic person 
talk. Mention your interests that you have a lot of information on. They
 will claim to know something. Make an incorrect statement, make a 
statement about x aspect is great even though its completely made up or 
bad for the use case. They will agree and confabulate a story that makes
 the incorrect opinion sound great. Just nod and agree, then distance 
yourself from them afterwards. do this 2-3 times on separate occasions 
to see how consistent they are with it. It's a good detection system. 
Give them rope to hang themselves.

TÍTULO: Why does it seem to me people born in the second half of the 2000s lack of empathy? : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
So I (20M) have noticed among the people I know (that are many, 
but of course I consider friends just few of them) that people younger 
than me are generally more rude and cold. For example many of them 
anytime I tried to be closer to them at the beginning seemed very 
friendly then abruptly changed their attitude and started being harsh, 
cold or ghosting me (very common technique for distance someone idk 
why). Maybe I have problems in socializing (for many years I was shy 
then this characteristic faded away but idk why some people changed 
attitude towards me from one day to another) maybe I am very peculiar, 
maybe in late teens younger (even slightly)  people might have a mindset
 way less mature than people my age or older (which I found myself more 
comfortable with, even middle aged people not that rarely) or maybe I am
 a bit focused on other’s opinion and must care less about it. Any help?
 (Please I kindly ask you no insults or sarcastic comments because it is
 a hard time, I also lost a dear relative yesterday and already having 
some personal problems)

yes, teens have always been assholes, but as a substitute teacher 
who has seen the deterioration of behavior over many years and across 
all grade levels, the average kid/teen has been getting worse.
bad behavior isn’t something that can be easily quantified, and 
you can’t rely on school discipline statistics because schools today 
have to do that less for political reasons. so good data on this doesn’t
 exist. but nearly every teacher i’ve talked to says the same thing. 
these are not old, out-of-touch teachers either, they are around my age 
(late 20s) or younger bc of how high turnover is
Yeah i agree. I don’t understand why people just keep letting 
teenagers just be reckless and make unnecessary mistakes. Allowing this 
kind of behavior because “their brain isn’t developed” is the reason why
 the maturity level is just gonna be continuously pushed up. You give an
 inch, they take a mile.We are gonna get to a point where late 20s 
adults just aren’t capable of figuring out anything on their own.I don’t
 see the benefit of treating everyone under 25 as some helpless child. 
It’s ridiculous now.
People use “my frontal lobe isn’t done developing” as an excuse 
now to not act like an adult until they’re at least 25. It’s getting 
absurd. A lot of people enjoy being helpless and don’t wanna take on the
 responsibilities that come with being a grown adult
You cant just sit here and say the kids are just kids. Everyone 
knows there's an extreme problem with their development and behavior in 
THIS generation. Yall ignore that in a misguided effort to stop 
"generation hate" from ppl acting like boomers.
Yep, i was a huge asshole as a teenager
I’m 24 and still coming out of adolescence it’s like a blurring transition of wtfs

[[deleted]]: Because they grew up with a damn ipad Infront of them and dont 
know how to interact with people, then again, my generation isn't really
 that much better it was just a DS.
It's the cell phone
I don't think it's perfectly comparable, to say that an iPad and a
 DS are the same thing. iPads can pretty much only work with the 
internet connected to them, which means that these kids are oftentimes 
exposed to content they shouldn't be (porn, those weird ass alpha male 
podcasts, very extreme opinions and misinformation they cannot identify 
properly because they're too young to have already developed critical 
thinking skills), while DS were games that came in a "controlled" 
environment.
It wasn't okay to drop kids in front of devices anyways, but 
there's a staggering difference between a kid lacking some empathy 
because he prefers to play Super Mario than be with his peer and a kid 
who lacks empathy because he spends the night watching videos about how 
women are subhumans, the Holocaust never happened, and black people 
deserve to be enslaved.
A ds and an iPhone are completely different. A ds is just a Game.

[Renagonx]: Stop me when I'm wrong but I get the feeling that life is 
transactional for a lot of young people these days due to a large amount
 of disrespect and neglect
[[deleted]]: Their parents were probably Xennials who saw the news turn into a 
fear machine. Y2K, 9/11, rise in gun violence, and multiple wars. Those 
parents taught their kids the world is a terrible place and no one can 
be trusted. So the kids probably assumed that meant don’t be polite and 
welcoming to anyone. I’m sure if those kids trusted you, they would open
 up too.
Idk how big the influence of parents is in their personalities 
(knowing most of them hate their families, and with this sentence I am 
not saying that every family is good and loving) however I noticed too 
they think the world is at war with them. Back in 2000s the “social 
conflicts” among young people was “we and the others” (the classical 
nerds vs populars) now it seems to have become “me and the others” (if 
you notice is too common to find “mental health coaches”, who I doubt 
they have really studied psychology, that makes content saying “ten 
signs a beloved of yours is a narcissist/sociopath/manipulator”). If you
 notice teen targeted media does not make anymore the nerd vs cool 
content, more like a “pure alt protagonist in a word of toxic people 
(who can be either alt or normies)”

[JeelyPiece]: Pandemic stunted a generation - just wait until they're in charge!
[Prestigious_Flower57]: Because they’re teenagers, we were all like that 3/4 years ago too
[GreenChile_ClamCake]: I’m only 28 and I’m already terrified to get old. Gen Z is using 
ChatGPT to pass school, so many of them lack social skills and empathy, 
many don’t actually wanna work full time jobs. Take care of your health 
now because the future of healthcare looks very bleak
[[deleted]]: Because their parents probably raised them as friends not parents
So true, I know a girl my age who sometimes go to clubs and bars 
with her mom, she is 48 and shares clothes with daughters!! (Aged 20,16 
and 13!!!)

[Far-Mix-5008]: Technology: the less time you spend with real people and the more 
you see real people through a screen, you subconsciously start to see 
them as fake. When it gets far enough and you meet those people in the 
real world, you'll treat them as such. Also being rude is normalized on 
sm so you'll normalize it in real life.
Social skills: the lack of social skills due to technology, less tolerance. Phones really have replaced ppl.
[noealz]: Cuz we keep going through so many once in a lifetime catastrophe and everyone’s trying to scam you
[tonylouis1337]: Lack of solid values being taught to them by their elders, peers or media.
[[deleted]]: They are still teenagers, they havn’t seen how the real world works yet and still have to mature.
[dy1ng1nside]: because look at our fucking leaders and role models, they’re all corrupt stealing pedofiles and we becoming what we see
[[deleted]]: Op mind your own business
[Cold_Animal_5709]: that would be because they’re growing. most teenagers are self-focused because they’re developing a sense of self
[JT45z]: They are teenagers. Of course they are fickle
[OmericanAutlaw]: they never learned how to read on account of the spider-man and elsa porn they watched on youtube
[Embarrassed_View8672]: It's hard to judge, I say this as a teacher who has seen the worst
 in students. Time will tell, as to whether it's mainly an age related 
thing or a generational thing.
[[deleted]]: Take a blinker bro, it'll be ight.
[Correct_Weather_9112]: ngl i was terrible when i was 15-17, so it comes with age for sure
I hope so. I tend to get along very well generally with people 
born before 2005 and people born from 2005 seem to me like a bunch of 
hypersensitive manipulators (or wanna be manipulators). Maybe I was 
wrong in trying to be friends with people younger just because “I am 
someone who likes socializing”

[Calm_Click8216]: I’ve always noticed kids have more empathy than anyone else. If 
anything the majority of older generations lack empathy. They don’t care
 about anyone but themselves, their retirement, their money, their 
religion, their politics. Especially boomers.
Maybe in the current narcissistic society everyone lacks of 
empathy , from silent generation to Gen alpha. Oldies tend to justify 
abusive behavior as “necessary to fortify you” while young people tend 
to label everything as toxic/microaggresive/abusive. I think it is fault
 of the individualistic capitalist society we live in
I couldn’t agree more.
Then kiddos are not empathetic, just over sensitive (and at the same time oldies are just incredibly naive and stubborn)

We are in the first half of 2020s, second half of 2000s ended 15 years ago
Nah you are thinking about it wrong … if you say 1900s that is all
 the 1900s and the second half would be after 1950. Just because the 
second half hasn’t happened yet doesn’t change when it is
Ok then I will say “the second half of the first decade of the 21st century 🎩🫖🧐”

[Comfortable-Table-57]: That is mostly a western-descended thing for those.
Most likely because they went through covid; which results them to
 use social media more, and with the prolonged use of social media, lack
 of empathy and arrogance occurs.
I also notice this too. In the past, friendships were easy, 
chatting and conversations were frequent i see in that college near to 
my house a 2-5 years ago, however now as I am in college, students 
within that near college have no manners and are just glued to their 
social media
2007 and In college? Congrats man you must be very hard working and ambitious 💪
Here in UK yes. College (sixth form college) is 16-20.

sweep it under the rug, when everyone and their mom knows this 
generation needs help, is counterproductive and sad. You trying to help 
by stopping gender wars and teens will be teens just fuels the problem.

I have always turned the other cheek and received smacks over 
smacks, maybe people are too used to bad things that consider kindness 
as aggression, I quite understand those poor souls. We all grew up 
thanks to Disney or in general American mainstream movies that evil gets
 karma, and sadly is not always like this. Maybe the cruel things in the
 world inspired them to be cruel and the good things inspired us to be 
kind and gentle but maybe we cannot live together

[BomanSteel]: I mean if your talking 2006 and up your just barely in their age range. You’re at different points in life.
Also, Why are you, a 20 year old, trying to talk to people 18 and below? Go talk to people your age and up
Bro is 20 and you expect him to talk to 40 year olds rather than 17 (the age he was like in 2021)
This shaming for talking to people within one's age group needs to
 stop. It's people like you that have created this increasing paranoia 
around any kind of small age difference that harms relationships and 
potential happiness.
Don’t even pay people like this any mind, you can’t reason with 
lower iq people. I’m deadass serious,logic is something they just aren’t
 capable of
I think reasoning with low iq people has its merits…I mean I’m talking to you afterall
🤣😐
Cool assumption but let’s make things clear. You can hang around 
people younger than you but don’t complain if they act in ways you don’t
 agree with. Especially when your college age and you talking to people 
high school age
Also, Why are you, a 20 year old, trying to talk to people 18 and below? Go talk to people your age and up
A 20 year old and an 18 year old are pretty much peers, what are you talking about?
First off, 18 is the max age range he was talking about. That’s 
the most charitable it gets, if he’s just talking to 18 year old then 
fine.
But either way, if you wanna talk to people college freshman to HS
 senior age don’t complain when your at different stages in life
It’s pretty reasonable that OP would interact with teenagers 
through mutual friends and such. Ergo his bestie is 18/19 and they have a
 brother who’s 16 and, as a result of the shared connection, often times
 finds himself in the company of those two brother and a mix of ages 
ranging from 14 to 20.
This is how real life interaction does, and always has, worked. 
People who think that 20 year olds have no honest reason to ever be in a
 non-pedo social situation with people 5~ years younger than them are 
just telling on how terminally online they are.

 out from the question.

lacking empathy. I would just think "you're not there yet" or "they

Personally, I don’t see any reason to feel empathetic towards anyone or anything.
Human decency? Hope for a better situation? Because fuck it, maybe it’ll make me feel good to be nice to people?
I’ve constantly been mistreated my entire life, and no one has ever really shown me any sort of unconditional kindness,
Your like 17. I highly doubt you know the real feeling of being 
mistreated your whole life. Hell you probably don’t remember half of the
 “entire life” you were “mistreated”. Tighten up. Your “no empathy for 
anyone” attitude isn’t gonna get you anywhere
Comment deleted by user
you most likely aren’t part of my demographic (brown in the US, short, and unattractive).
2 out of the 3 kid and honestly being tall and black is worse than
 being short, cause people start thinking your scary looking when your 
too tall and too dark.
If you were more like me you’d be pretty apathetic too lol.
I’m apathetic to many things, including public displays of self loathing. That’s why I said Tighten up.
dude, I fall into your "demographic" but that doesn't mean you 
can't show empathy to people who have been through some shit in their 
lives. Just b/c you haven't experienced it, doesn't mean you shouldn't 
exhibit it towards others...
Crazy how when someone thats in his demographic and can relate to 
him calls him out he goes silent. Bros not even trying to hear 
legitimate advice
what is incredible is that, I see this kind of a mentality quite often... it is quite saddening
Plenty of us had shitty lives while growing up, we don't all end up assholes with victim complexes though.
That’s funny, I’ve known this community since around 2019 (when 
you were 12 lol) and y’all still haven’t changed, especially your weird 
obsession with race.
As a not so tall (somewhere between 5’11 and 6’0 in your stupid 
American system) mixed guy, I say getting women is actually really easy,
 since I know that’s your problem. So don’t really use this as an 
excuse, for me for ex tan skin with green eyes always gets them, lol.
Idk how you look like, but I’m sure it can’t be this bad, not 
enough to really fuck up your life (which would be having unsettling 
features that actually scare people), so if you really just want 
bitches, literally just try and you’ll get it, also looksmaxxing 
actually works and you can get 1 or even 2 points up with this, so try 
this as well.
So yeah, not really an excuse, although I do agree that you have 
no reason to show empathy, that’s a decision you should make yourself. 
And thanks younger incels for the edits I see on instagram, they go 
kinda hard actually
you took all those words out of my mouth, thanks for articulating it quite well
Hahah really hopes he answers this one
As a short, unattractive, brown male
I am sorry bro, its ovER. I wish that if there is an afterlife, you could be 6'5 tall white chad.
I don't see any reason to feel empathetic towards anyone or anything
The idea of empathy is cope anyways. Nobody really cares about 
other people, and espically for sub5 men. Might as well not exist.

Yea I hope so. Cause this life really isnt worth it when u sub5. It honestly eats me up mentally every day.
But if it makes you feel a bit better, there are tons of other guys, including myself who are sub5 inkwells as well.
Sometimes it easier to feel empathy for animals than humans.
Yeah no shit because we don’t live in their “society” so we don’t really know what happens there
[BomanSteel]: Personally, I don’t see any reason to feel empathetic towards anyone or anything.
Human decency? Hope for a better situation? Because fuck it, maybe it’ll make me feel good to be nice to people?
I’ve constantly been mistreated my entire life, and no one has ever really shown me any sort of unconditional kindness,
Your like 17. I highly doubt you know the real feeling of being 
mistreated your whole life. Hell you probably don’t remember half of the
 “entire life” you were “mistreated”. Tighten up. Your “no empathy for 
anyone” attitude isn’t gonna get you anywhere

you most likely aren’t part of my demographic (brown in the US, short, and unattractive).
2 out of the 3 kid and honestly being tall and black is worse than
 being short, cause people start thinking your scary looking when your 
too tall and too dark.
If you were more like me you’d be pretty apathetic too lol.
I’m apathetic to many things, including public displays of self loathing. That’s why I said Tighten up.
dude, I fall into your "demographic" but that doesn't mean you 
can't show empathy to people who have been through some shit in their 
lives. Just b/c you haven't experienced it, doesn't mean you shouldn't 
exhibit it towards others...
Crazy how when someone thats in his demographic and can relate to 
him calls him out he goes silent. Bros not even trying to hear

--- DOCUMENTO: You will get the opposite of what you want _ r_GenZ.htm ---
TÍTULO: You will get the opposite of what you want : r/GenZ
POST: A place for members or non-members of Generation Z to talk
 and hang out. Gen-Z is widely considered to be 1996-2012, but may 
change based on your opinion.
Late night, drinking wine and listening to Miles Davis. I figured 
I'd impart my wisdom on the youth, optimism is the thief of joy, 
whatever you value the opposite will be given to you. If you value 
education, you will never attain it. If you value family you'll end up 
alone and if you venerate your career you'll never get far. In this 
world the ungrateful and the insincere are rewarded and those honest and
 noble are left behind to suffer. If you want to suceed in any task 
simply hate it and it will pay dividends.
COMENTARIOS FILTRADOS:
[Infamous_Elk7432]: Ah, you’ve hit the doomer stage, been there, it sucks, alcohol 
makes it worse.  I’m sorry to hear that you only now find pleasure in 
drug abuse. (alcohol is one of the most destructive legal drugs in the 
world) but inner peace comes not from depression. Rather, self work. 
Looking yourself in the mirror and asking questions you don’t want to 
think about… “Am I happy?” “Am I a good person” (if the answer to either
 of those is no, time to get to work) what you have isn’t inner-peace. 
It’s nihilism. There’s a large difference
I’m not a doomer
… okay. Then stop acting like one?
So you’re just going to ignore the rest of what I said and choose what you presume to be an insult to respond to?

[mm_delish]: I’m 25 and have had problems with addiction. You are lying to yourself. Snap out of it.
That’s not relevant to me, I don’t have an “addiction”. It’s an 
easy cop out I know for you to say that, but it’s transparent you’re not
 at my level of understanding lil bro.

[Cheesymaryjane]: drinking wine
At least smoke some grass if you’re gonna impart “deep” knowledge
It doesn't do anything for me, drugs don't work on me.
You know alcohol is a drug, right?

[BomanSteel]: Oh shit. Lemme just hate winning the lottery real quick.
[lost_NPC_Sandy]: I disagree. I valued education and got rewarded with good grades and knowleadge that helps me every day.
[Ubatsi]: This is the most doomer post I’ve seen in a minute are you okay?
I'm doing pretty good, just dropping knowledge for the kids to learn from
You should look into therapy buddy, I’m not sure what happened to you but you have a super illogical toxic mindset.
Best wishes homie

I don't suffer from addiction: I think for other people, other 
people don't think for me. My burden is it's my responsibility to think 
for others to ensure things remain in order.
“The kids”, you’re 26 buddy.
I’m old enough to be a parent lmfao, come on man
Genuinely fuck you for trying to make the world a worse of place, by trying to teach kids hatred
What I’m doing is a kindness, I am saving others life lessons they
 otherwise would’ve learned the hard way. I would’ve been so happy to 
have sometime teach me what I’m teaching others. I shouldn’t be 
chastised. I should be celebrated.
My life's utter shit too, but I don't go around telling people to 
not have hope and "piece is found in depression" or whatever
My life isn’t utter shit though
If you need to drink to “meet your inner child” or whatever, you are not fine. Please, get help.
My inner child wtf? You’re adding words bro
The narcissism and delusions of grandeur are palpable here

[Due-Bandicoot-2554]: Its quite the opposite actually, you could actually be able to 
achieve something if you actually tried. I don’t know how hard you 
fucked up but alchohol and establishing a cult on the internet of people
 that share your opinion is not going to solve that.
Give it 15 more years son, I don't blame you for your ignorance, 
because once I thought like you, but rather I forgive you for it.
I'm 2 years older than you and you're pathetic
Sadly have to agree with the pathetic part, they remind me of my 
uncle. An alcohol doomer who'd always tell me "your body stops working 
when old" that's cause he never got up and only drank liquor and did 
meth. Also told me liking brown woman is bad(am a brown man, fuck 
colorism)
This nibba is on dbdr subreddit posting normie takes.
Plus 2010-1998 = 12 not 15
You are not old enough to unironically be calling people “son” lmao.
How so? Since you’re the judge of these matters how old should you be then to say son?

[notreallygoodatthis2]: It seems more the case that you just feel for the absence of what 
you value more than you feel for the absence of what you don't.
But yes, the world generally endorses immorality in practice.
[moros-17]: sucks to hear but very real, optimism never got me anywhere in life
Bro your Gen Z, you weren’t allowed to go anywhere with your life without your parents permission for the majority of it.
Y’all really talking like hope/optimism has failed you 100s of 
times when you weren’t even considered an adult for that long.
not to be cliche, but you don't know me, you don't know my life. 
my parents have been absolutely useless, and i've seen more in 18 years 
than most people have in 40.
I'm not gonna lie, I was about to roast you for saying that but I 
double checked your profile just in case and... Yeah... fair enough
But  this advice is still BS, the OP clearly has issues and is 
drinking too cope. You don't have to think life is all sunshine and 
rainbows but nothing gets better if people don't have some 
hope/expectation that things could be better
Yeah i also completely misread it the first time, i said this to 
someone else but i read it as a "don't go chasing waterfalls" type thing
 and that was not what he was saying
Optimism doesn't get you anywhere on its own, but taking charge, planning and doing stuff does.
yeah, that's more of what i meant at least. I think i read this 
post wrong originally, i read it as more of a "don't go chasing 
waterfalls" thing not "if you hate your job you'll be more successful"
yeah op was close to a good point but then just kept going on the first half of it and never got around to the point.

[Infamous_Elk7432]: Have you ever looked into existential philosophy?
[7-rats-in-a-coat]: Hey, I hope you’re okay, would you consider talking about this to a therapist?
Therapy is a waste, when I was in college I learned a lot about 
psychology and therapeutic communication. Basically it’s all just 
redirection, reenforcing self-empathy, and looking for reasons why 
you’re ultimately not accountable, but rather your personal 
accountability is how you react to what troubles you. Ultimately you’re 
telling somebody things they want to hear to make them feel seen and 
heard while actually doing nothing at all.
Nothing gets solved, nothing changes, nothing ultimately gets 
tackled. It’s the equivalent of saying I’m starving and I’m jealous of 
this man who is eating a steak and lobster in front of me and the 
therapist’s solution is ok ask yourself why you’re jealous and focus on 
those feelings and trying to understand why you feel that way, maybe 
those feelings aren’t actually hunger but rather something else? That’s 
where your journey should begin.
I think that is a bleak way to look at the world and hope you find a consistent source of joy in your life.

[No-Construction4527]: Yup. Harsh truth.
Life rarely goes as planned is my advice to the younger generation.
But it’s still alright. Always have a plan b.
